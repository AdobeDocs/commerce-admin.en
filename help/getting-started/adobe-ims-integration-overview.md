# Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) integration overview

{{ee-feature}}

Adobe Commerce Admin users who have an Adobe account can now use their Adobe ID to log in to Adobe Commerce. Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) is Adobe's OAuth 2.0-based identity management feature that supports authentication. Integrating the Commerce Admin authentication into Adobe Business Product's IMS authentication workflow can streamline the authentication process for users who work with other Adobe products. This integration is optional and is enabled on a per-instance basis. Only Admin user workflows are affected when this integration is enabled. 

The modules that are required for the Commerce Admin IMS integration are packaged in  `adobe-ims-metapackage`, which is bundled with Adobe Commerce core releases. 

To implement this integration, see [Configure the Commerce Admin Integration with IMS](./adobe-ims-config.md).

## Changes to Admin workflows and interface after integration with IMS

When this integration is enabled, Commerce Admin users experience changes to the default Commerce Admin login and authentication workflow as they perform routine tasks in the Admin that require reauthentication, such as creating an Admin user. Two-factor authentication (2FA) enforcement on the Adobe organization level is required for module enablement. The default Admin login and 2FA are disabled, and the _[!UICONTROL Sign In with Adobe ID]_ button replaces the default Admin sign in form. Entitlements are still managed from the Admin.

## How Admin integration with IMS affects Commerce passwords

Commerce deployments that have been integrated with Adobe IMS require an Adobe ID account with access to the Adobe IMS organization that is configured for the Commerce application during the IMS enablement process.  When the IMS integration is enabled, admin users authenticate through the Adobe sign in page using their Adobe credentials. The Commerce passwords and user names for admin users are no longer used for authentication as long as the Adobe IMS integration is enabled.

If the IMS integration is disabled, admin users must authenticate through Adobe Commerce again using their Commerce user name and password. Admin users should save their Commerce Admin credentials (username and password) and 2FA credentials before enabling this integration.

Certain backend components that are involved in user authentication still require a non-null password. To meet this requirement, Commerce creates random passwords for newly created admin users in the `admin_user` table.

User accounts and role permissions for the Commerce application are still managed from the Commerce Admin.


## Web API token generation with IMS credentials

Commerce Admin APIs are affected when Admin authentication with Adobe IMS is enabled in a Commerce instance. Admin users can no longer use the credentials issued by the Commerce instance. These are the credentials required to log in to the Admin and to obtain access tokens that services can use to make requests to the Admin REST and SOAP APIs. 

After the Adobe IMS integration is enabled, admin users must use [Adobe IMS OAuth tokens](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/OAuthIntegration/) for Adobe Commerce API endpoints that require authentication. Client solutions obtain the tokens dynamically for web API use. This authentication mechanism is enabled for REST and SOAP web API areas as part of configuring this integration.

See [Token-based authentication](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/webapi/get-started/authentication/gs-authentication-token/) for an overview of how web APIs use Commerce access tokens, including IMS access tokens.

## Commerce session management and Adobe IMS access tokens

Access tokens hold both user credentials and login session information. Once a user has been authenticated and a session has begun, these two variables are added to the user's session:

`token_last_check_time`. Identifies the current time and is used by the `\Magento\AdminAdobeIms\Plugin\BackendAuthSessionPlugin` plugin.

`adobe_access_token` — Identifies the `ACCESS_TOKEN` value received during authorization.

The `\Magento\AdminAdobeIms\Plugin\BackendAuthSessionPlugin` plugin checks if the `token_last_check_time` was updated 10 min ago. If the `token_last_check_time` was checked ten minutes ago, then the authentication workflow makes an API call to IMS to validate the access token, and the session continues. If the access token is valid, then the `token_last_check_time` value is updated to the current time. If the token is not valid, the session is terminated.

## Important files

`adminAdobeIms` - Provides an implementation of the Admin login based on the `AdobeImsApi` module.

`admin_adobe_ims_webapi` -  Maintains a record of all validated access tokens. When a token is validated or invalidated, a record of its status is preserved in this table.

`adobeIms` - Implements all the business logic that is related to integration with Adobe IMS (preserved to prevent backward incompatibilities).

`adobeImsApi` - Declares the interfaces that support integration with Adobe IMS.

`adminadobe-ims.log` - Error log file.

## Enable the integration

The Adobe IMS metapackage is installed with Adobe Commerce 2.4.5 and higher, but must be configured for use. It extends the `AdobeIms` module to support the module that enables authentication logic (`AdminAdobeIms`).

For more information about enabling the integration, see [Configure the Commerce Admin Integration with Adobe IMS](./adobe-ims-config.md).
