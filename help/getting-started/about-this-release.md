### [!DNL Commerce] modes

Your [!DNL Commerce] installation can be deployed to run in either production or developer mode. Some tools and configuration settings are designed specifically for developers, and can be accessed only while the store is running in developer mode.

Most topics in this guide apply to a [!DNL Commerce] installation that is running in production mode. See the [Developer](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/advanced/developer.html) section of the [Advanced](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/advanced.html) configuration settings page for more information.

The [!DNL Commerce] mode can be changed only from the command line of the server by a user with appropriate permissions. See [Set the Mode](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-mode.html) in the developer documentation for more information.


## 2.3.x documentation

The [[!DNL Commerce] 2.3 User Guide][8]{:target="_blank"} remains available on the docs.magento.com domain until it reaches end of life/end of support.
