# Release information

It is a best practice to keep your Commerce installation up to date, so you can benefit from the latest fixes, improvements, and advancements. Release notes provide a detailed description of the changes in each product release, with links to additional technical information, installation instructions, and support resources. To learn more about the current release, see:

## Installation

To download and install the latest 2.4.x release on your own infrastructure, see the [_Installation Guide_][3] and [_Configuration Guide_][4]. To deploy the latest 2.4.x release on the Adobe cloud infrastructure, see the [_Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure Guide_](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/overview.html).

The _Installation Guide_ provides information on installing Adobe Commerce. Reviewing the following information is recommended:

- [System requirements][5]
- [Prerequisites][6]
- [Post Installation][7]

## Commerce modes

Your Commerce installation can be deployed to run in either production or developer mode. Some tools and configuration settings are designed specifically for developers, and can be accessed only while the store is running in developer mode.

Most topics in this guide apply to a Commerce installation that is running in production mode. See the [Developer](../configuration-reference/advanced/developer.md) page of the _Configuration Reference Guide_.

The Commerce mode can be changed only from the command line of the server by a user with appropriate permissions. See [Set the operation mode](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/set-mode.html) in the _Configuration Guide_.
