## [!DNL Commerce] modes

Your [!DNL Commerce] installation can be deployed to run in either production or developer mode. Some tools and configuration settings are designed specifically for developers, and can be accessed only while the store is running in developer mode.

Most topics in this guide apply to a [!DNL Commerce] installation that is running in production mode. See the [Developer](../configuration-reference/advanced/developer.md) page of the _Configuration Reference Guide_.

The [!DNL Commerce] mode can be changed only from the command line of the server by a user with appropriate permissions. See [Set the operation mode](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/set-mode.html) in the _Configuration Guide_.


## 2.3.x documentation

The [[!DNL Commerce] 2.3 User Guide][8] remains available on the `docs.magento.com` domain until it reaches end of life/end of support.
