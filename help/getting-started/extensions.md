# Extensions from Adobe

This topic provides information about PHP extensions for Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source that are released by Adobe.

Extensions add features, functionality, services, and integrations to the Admin and storefront. Some of these extensions are developed through Magento Open Source Community contributions. Some extensions are installed by default, and others require separate installation.

+++Learn more about extending Adobe Commerce

Adobe provides two main approaches to extend or customize your Adobe Commerce projects:

- In-process extensibility: Uses custom code and extensions that run within the Adobe Commerce application process like PHP extensions. This traditional approach allows deep integration but requires careful management during upgrades.

- Out-of-process extensibility: Uses custom code and applications that operate independently from the core software. This modern approach helps reduce total cost of ownership by:

  - Simplifying upgrades since extensions are decoupled from the core
  - Giving developers more control over implementation timing and methods
  - Enabling independent scaling and maintenance of extension components

Adobe Commerce offers strategies and tools to support both types of extensibility. To learn more, see [Adobe Commerce extensibility](https://developer.adobe.com/commerce/extensibility/).

## Adobe extensions installed by default

The following Adobe extensions are included with Adobe Commerce and installed automatically with the Adobe Commerce application. Some extensions require further configuration or enablement in the Admin as noted in the extension description.

### [!DNL Inventory Management]

[!DNL Commerce] [[!DNL Inventory Management]](../inventory-management/introduction.md) provides enhanced stock and shipment management across one or multiple locations and sales channels with concurrent checkout protection and shipment-matching algorithms. Track your inventory quantities, provide accurate salable stock amounts to customers, and ship according to recommendations or manual selections to control your entire inventory. Configure management settings globally, per source, and per product.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This extension was developed as part of the [[!DNL Inventory Management]](https://github.com/magento/inventory) (formerly MSI) project through the Community Engineering program.

[!DNL Inventory Management] installs with all features enabled by default. No additional steps are required to enable these inventory features. For details about the [!DNL Inventory Management] capabilities, see the [[!DNL Inventory Management] User Guide](../inventory-management/guide-overview.md).

### Braintree

PayPal and Gene Commerce together developed the official Braintree extension for Commerce 2.4.x stores. Featuring an improved checkout experience designed to drive conversion, the updates include PayLater options that automatically show relevant PayLater messages and buttons to consumers while shopping and during checkout.

This extension is installed by default, but requires a [Braintree account](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) and configuration in the Admin to be enabled for your store. To determine the fees that apply when using Braintree to process your transactions, check the [Braintree pricing](https://www.braintreepayments.com/braintree-pricing).

For information about Braintree configuration in the Admin, see the [Braintree](../stores-purchase/braintree.md) topic in the _Sales and Purchase Experience Guide_.

### Google reCAPTCHA

Google reCAPTCHA provides a greater level of security for both the storefront and Admin UI than is available with standard CAPTCHA and gives you the ability to:

- Verify when customers create accounts, retrieve passwords, log in to their accounts, or contact your company.
- Enhance security when Admin users log in.

It reduces potential user error when entering a Captcha code and encourages cart conversion without adding hurdles during checkout. [Enable and configure reCAPTCHA](../systems/security-google-recaptcha.md) using invisible or interactive checks to enhance secure access to the [!DNL Commerce] Admin and storefront.

### Two-factor authentication

The [!DNL Commerce] Admin provides all access to your store, orders, and customer data. [Two-factor authentication](../systems/security-two-factor-authentication.md) (2FA or TFA) improves security by requiring additional authentication, beyond the standard login name and password, to access the [!DNL Commerce] Admin from all devices. The extension supports multiple authenticators including Google Authenticator, Authy, [!DNL Duo], and U2F keys. This authentication applies to Admin users only. It is not available for storefront customer accounts.

These features are enabled by default. Each Admin user must install and configure one of the supported authenticators.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Adobe Commerce stores that have enabled Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) authentication for the Admin have native Commerce 2FA disabled. Users who are logged into the Admin with their Adobe credentials do not need to reauthenticate for many Admin tasks. Authentication is handled by Adobe IMSÂ when the Admin user logs into their current session. See [Adobe Identity Management Service (IMS) Integration Overview](./adobe-ims-integration-overview.md).
