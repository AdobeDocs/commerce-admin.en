# Create and Access Your Commerce Account

Your Commerce account has a separate login from your store Admin. You can access this account from either the Commerce website or from your store Admin. From the dashboard of your Commerce account, you can find information that is related to the products and services that you have purchased, as well as your contact and billing information.

Anyone can open a free Commerce account from the website. The email address that is used to open an account can be associated with only one account, and the screen name that you enter becomes your identity in the forums.

## Link your Commerce account

You can link your Commerce account to your Adobe ID for single sign-on across all Adobe Commerce products and simpler user account management. When your Commerce accounts are linked to an Adobe ID in the Commerce Identity Manager and you are logged into that Adobe ID, you bypass the standard Commerce product login process. See [Setup Commerce Identity Manager](commerce-identity-manager.md).
