# Access your [!DNL Commerce] account

You can access the account from the [!DNL Commerce] website. From the dashboard of your [!DNL Commerce] account, you can find information that is related to the products and services that you have purchased, as well as your contact and billing information. Some information is visible to license owners only.

Your [!DNL Commerce] account login is separate from your store Admin login. You will normally use different credentials for each, and access to each system is managed independently.

However, a user who wants to streamline their login to Adobe Commerce and Adobe Business products will be able to configure their Adobe ID to login to the store Admin: [Configure the Commerce Admin Integration with Adobe ID](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-config)

>[!NOTE]

>After you create your account, it is recommended that you use Two-factor Authentication (TFA) to [secure your account](commerce-account-secure.md).

>Use the email address that is associated with your existing Commerce account MAGEID to create the Adobe ID. Using a different, brand new email address creates a new MAGEID.
