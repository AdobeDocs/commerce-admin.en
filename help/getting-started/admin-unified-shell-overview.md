# Commerce Admin Unified Shell Integration Overview

The Commerce Admin on Unified Shell integration deploys the Commerce Admin within the Adobe Unified Shell application to deliver a common user interface to manage Adobe Experience Cloud applications.  With the integration, Admin users have single sign-on access to Adobe Commerce and other Experience Cloud applications along with added capabilities like an integrated Help Center, easy access to the Experience Cloud dashboard, and seamless switching between Experience Cloud applications. 

When the integration is enabled, requests to the Adobe Commerce Admin are redirected to the Unified Shell application proxy URL, and the Commerce Admin UI is embedded in the Unified Shell application as shown in the following figure.

Commerce Admin workflows remain the same, but Admin users can now complete additional tasks from the Unified Shell menu:

- Search for product documentation, tutorials, and community posts
- Access global product announcements and notifications in addition to notifications specific to Adobe Commerce
- Globally search the Commerce Admin 
- Manage account preferences (alerts, notifications, and subscriptions)
- Report issues or share ideas using the Feedback form
- Switch seamlessly between Adobe Commerce and other Experience Cloud applications

Commerce extension developers can integrate with the Unified Shell application to deliver custom content, for example adding custom URLs to the Help Center.
