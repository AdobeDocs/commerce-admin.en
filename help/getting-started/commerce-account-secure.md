# Secure Your [!DNL Commerce] Account

Two-factor Authentication (TFA or 2FA) is an added layer of security to better protect your [!DNL Commerce] account from unauthorized access. To complete the login process, TFA requires a _second factor_ in addition to the standard username and password credentials. This second factor takes the form of temporary verification codes that are continuously generated by a TFA application installed on your mobile device and paired with your [!DNL Commerce] account.

With TFA enabled, your account is more secure. An unauthorized user cannot log in unless they have both your username and password credentials (first factor) and a valid verification code from the TFA application on your personal device (second factor).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The two-factor authentication that protects the _Admin_ of your store has a separate setup. To learn more, see [Two-Factor Authentication](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/security-two-factor-authentication.html).  

## Before you begin

To use TFA, you must have a TFA application installed on your personal device (such as your smartphone, tablet, computer). There are many available, but some popular and free options include:

- Google Authenticator (iOS, Android™, BlackBerry®)

- Authy (iOS, Android™)

- Microsoft® Authenticator (iOS, Android™, Windows Phone)

## Enable two-factor authentication

1. Log in to your [[!DNL Commerce] account][1]{:target="_blank"}.

1. In the left navigation pane, select **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]**, and then select **[!UICONTROL Two-factor Authentication]**.

   ![Enable TFA](./assets/2fa-enable.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Enable]** to begin the two-factor authentication setup process.

1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Verification Code]** sent to your email and select **[!UICONTROL Verify Code]** to continue.

   ![Enter the verification code](./assets/2fA-verification-code-prompt.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Open the two-factor authentication application you downloaded and installed on your personal device.

1. On the [!UICONTROL SETUP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION] form, use the **[!UICONTROL Setup Code]** to add Adobe Commerce to your TFA application.

   ![Add Adobe Commerce to TFA app](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-setup-app.png)<!-- zoom -->

   You can add the code by scanning the QR code using the TFA application, or by manually entering it. This code pairs your TFA application with your [!DNL Commerce] account and enables the permissions to generate the TFA app to generate verification codes for secure account access.

1. Complete the setup.

   -  On the [!UICONTROL SETUP TWO FACTOR-AUTHENTICATION] form, enter the verification code from your two-factor authentication application.
   
   - Select **[!UICONTROL Verify Code]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >For security, the verification codes in your TFA application continuously expire and regenerate. **_Always_** use the code that is currently displayed.

1. Save the **[!UICONTROL Recovery Codes]** presented in a safe and accessible place.

   ![Store recovery codes](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-store-recovery-codes.png)<!-- zoom -->

   If you cannot provide a verification code when you log in to your [!DNL Commerce] account, you must use a recovery code to regain account access.

   Each recovery code can be used only one time, but you can [generate](#generate-new-recovery-codes) new ones. Recovery codes are case-sensitive.

1. Select the confirmation checkbox and select **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to continue.

1. To ensure that you can recover access to your account, enter a **[!UICONTROL Recovery Email]**.

   This email address is needed if you cannot generate a verification code from your two-factor authentication application and you do not have access to an unused pre-generated recovery code.

   Once every 24 hours, you can generate and send a temporary recovery code to your designated recovery email address. Use this code to regain account access.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Maintain access to your recovery email account. Otherwise, you cannot use temporary recovery codes sent to that account.

   ![Set recovery email](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-set-recovery-email.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Select the confirmation checkbox and select **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to complete the two-factor authentication setup process.

   - A notification is sent to the email address associated with your [!DNL Commerce] account to confirm that you have successfully enabled two-factor authentication.

   - A notification is sent to your recovery email account to confirm the configuration.
