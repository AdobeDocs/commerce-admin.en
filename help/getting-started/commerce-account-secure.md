# Secure Your [!DNL Commerce] Account

Two-factor Authentication (TFA or 2FA) is an added layer of security to better protect your [!DNL Commerce] account from unauthorized users who might want to use your account in ways you do not want. TFA requires a _second factor_ (beyond your standard username and password combination) in order to complete the login process. This second factor takes the form of special, temporary verification codes that are continuously generated by a TFA application (on your mobile phone, for example) that is synced to your [!DNL Commerce] account. With TFA enabled, an unauthorized user must have your username and password combination (first factor) and access to the TFA application on your personal device (second factor) in order to log in to your [!DNL Commerce] account. This type of security makes unauthorized access much more difficult and, therefore, more secure.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The two-factor authentication that protects the _Admin_ of your store has a separate setup. To learn more, see [Two-Factor Authentication](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/security-two-factor-authentication.html).  

## Before you begin

In order to use TFA, you must have a TFA application installed on your personal device (such as your smartphone, tablet, computer). There are many available, but some popular and free options include:

- Google Authenticator (iOS, Android™, BlackBerry®)

- Authy (iOS, Android™)

- Microsoft® Authenticator (iOS, Android™, Windows Phone)

## Enable two-factor authentication

1. Log in to your [[!DNL Commerce] account][1]{:target="_blank"}.

1. In the left navigation pane, click **[!UICONTROL Account Settings]** and click **[!UICONTROL Two-factor Authentication]** underneath.

   ![Enable TFA](./assets/2fa-enable.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Enable]** to begin the two-factor authentication setup process.

1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Verification Code** sent to your device and click **[!UICONTROL Verify Code]** to continue.

   ![Enter verification code](./assets/2fA-verification-code-prompt.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Open the two-factor authentication application you downloaded and installed on your personal device.

1. On the [!UICONTROL SETUP TWO-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION] form, use the **[!UICONTROL Setup Code]** to add Adobe Commerce to your TFA application.

   ![Add Adobe Commerce to TFA app](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-setup-app.png)<!-- zoom -->

   You can add the code by scanning the QR code using the TFA application, or manually entering it. This code links your TFA application with your [!DNL Commerce] account and enables the permissions for the TFA app to generate verification codes for secure account access.

1. Complete the setup.

   -  On the [!UICONTROL SETUP TWO FACTOR-AUTHENTICATION] form, enter the verification code from your two-factor authentication application.
   
   - Select **[!UICONTROL Verify Code]**.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Verification Codes are constantly expiring and regenerated by your TFA application for security purposes, so **_always_** use the one that is currently displayed.

1. Save the **[!UICONTROL Recovery Codes]** presented in a safe and accessible place.

   If you cannot provide a Verification Code to log into your [!DNL Commerce] account, using a Recovery Code is the only way to regain access to your [!DNL Commerce] account.

   Each Recovery Code is one-time use only, so do not try to reuse a Recovery Code you have already used previously (but you can always generate more---see the following for details). Recovery Codes are case-sensitive.

1. Select the confirmation checkbox and click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to continue.

   ![Store recovery codes](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-store-recovery-codes.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. To help ensure that you can recover access to your account, enter a **[!UICONTROL Recovery Email]**.

   This email address is needed if you cannot generate a Verification Code from your two-factor authentication application and you do not have access to an unused pre-generated Recovery Code.

   Once every 24 hours, you are able to generate and send a temporary Recovery Code to your designated Recovery email address that you can use to regain access to your account.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >It is imperative that you maintain access to the email account of your Recovery Email; otherwise, you cannot access any temporary Recovery Codes sent to that account.

   ![Set recovery email](./assets/commerce-account-2fa-set-recovery-email.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Select the confirmation checkbox and click **[!UICONTROL Submit]** to complete the two-factor authentication setup process.

   - An email notification is sent to the email address associated with your [!DNL Commerce] account to confirm that you have successfully enabled two-factor authentication.

   - An email notification is sent to the Recovery Email that you designated to confirm that particular email address is on file as your Recovery Email for receiving a temporary Recovery Code.
