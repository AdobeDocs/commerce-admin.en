## Increase average order value

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source provide a range of tools to help you tailor the shopping experience, and encourage your customers to put more items in their shopping carts and spend more money.

- **Targeted Promotions** - Use catalog and shopping cart price rules to create [promotions](../merchandising-promotions/introduction.md#promotions) that kick into gear when a set of conditions is met. In Adobe Commerce, segment customers dynamically and build segments based on specific characteristics such as customer address, order history, shopping cart content, and much more. Then, use [[!DNL Page Builder]](../page-builder/introduction.md) to create a dynamic block that is triggered by a promotion, and appears only to the targeted customer segment.

## Loyalty and advocacy

Give customers a direct connection to your brand by allowing them to create customer accounts where they can see their purchase history, wish list, and newsletter subscription information. Use product ratings and reviews to give new customers objective product opinions and promote a sense of community. These features turn customer satisfaction into one of the most powerful and cost-efficient marketing tools at your disposal.

**Customer accounts** - Opening an account provides [customers](../customers/manage-account.md) with a personalized shopping experience that they can share with their friends. Customers can save their shopping preferences, and manage their own store billing and shipping information.

**Advocacy tools** - Customers who share [wish lists](../stores-purchase/wishlists.md) and send [gift cards](../catalog/product-gift-card-create.md) make a powerful endorsement of your brand.
