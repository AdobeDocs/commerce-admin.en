# Admin Message Inbox

Your store receives messages from Adobe regularly. The messages are rated by importance and might refer to system updates, patches, new releases, scheduled maintenance, or upcoming events. The bell icon in the header indicates the number of unread messages in your inbox.

Any message of critical importance appears in a pop-up window when you log into your store. The notice continues to appear after each login until the message is either marked as read or removed.

The _Notifications_ page lists all messages ranked by severity, with the most recent at the top. The Action commands can be used to mark individual messages as read, view more detailed information, or to remove the message from the inbox.

The configuration determines how often the inbox is updated, and how the messages are delivered. If your store Admin has a secure URL, notifications must be delivered over HTTPS.
