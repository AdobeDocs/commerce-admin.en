# Admin message inbox

Your store receives messages from Adobe regularly. The messages are rated by importance and might refer to system updates, patches, new releases, scheduled maintenance, or upcoming events. The bell icon in the header indicates the number of unread messages in your inbox.

The _[!UICONTROL Notifications]_ page lists all messages ranked by date. The _[!UICONTROL Action]_ commands can be used to mark individual messages as read, view more detailed information, or to remove the message from the inbox.

The configuration determines how often the inbox is updated, and how the messages are delivered. If your store Admin has a secure URL, notifications must be delivered over HTTPS.
