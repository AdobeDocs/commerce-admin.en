# Configure the Adobe Commerce Admin integration with Adobe IMS

This integration supports Adobe Commerce administrators who have an Adobe ID and who want to streamline login to Adobe Commerce and Adobe Business products. It is optional and is enabled on a per-instance basis. Only administrator workflows are affected when enabled.Â 


## Prerequisites

* Adobe Commerce 2.4.5 or later
* An Adobe.com account with access to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/). 
* New administrators must create an account with an Adobe ID to log in.
* The administrator who is enabling this integration needs the following credentials during module enablement:

  * Organization ID. (obtained from [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)). The authenticated user must belong to this IMS organization. Must be at least 24 characters in length.
  * Client ID
  * Client secret
  * Client ID and client secret are available after you retrieve API keys in the [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/).

## General steps

* Get Adobe Org ID from the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)
* Generate a new project, IMS API keys, and secret from the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/)
* Enable the `AdminAdobeIms` module
* Configure Adobe Commerce admins in the Adobe Admin Console.

Once a new Adobe ID is created for an administrator, you must manually create an Adobe Commerce administrator account with the same name and email if one does not exist. A successful integration requires that all Adobe Commerce administrators have Adobe Admin accounts with the same administrator name and primary email address.

Once you have completed these steps, the [!UICONTROL Sign into Adobe Commerce with Adobe IMS] button is available from the Adobe Commerce login page.

### Step 1: Get Adobe Org ID

You must belong to at least one IMS organization to enable this feature. If you have an Adobe ID, then by default you belong to at least one Adobe organization. Log in to the [Adobe Admin Console](https://adminconsole.adobe.com/) to retrieve your organization ID. 

### Step 2: Generate a new project, IMS API keys, and secret

You must have an Adobe account to generate a new project and register it in IMS.

1. Login to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/).
1. Go to the [!UICONTROL Projects] tab (adobe.io/projects) and click [!UICONTROL Create a new project].
1. Click [!UICONTROL Add API] on the newly created Project page.
1. Select [!UICONTROL Adobe Services] >  [!UICONTROL Adobe Commerce Admin IMS].
1. Select [!UICONTROL Oauth 2.0 Web].
1. Specify the [!UICONTROL Redirect URI:] https://<hostname>/<backend_frontname>/adobe_ims/oauth/callback/
1. Specify the [!UICONTROL Redirect URI pattern:] https://<hostname>/<backend_frontname>/adobe_ims/oauth/callback/.*. You must escape any dots in the hostname by preceding the dots with \\. Adding a wildcard to the end  of the URL supports the Adobe Commerce Admin secret key.
1. Click [!UICONTROL Save configured API].
1. Copy the [!UICONTROL Client ID] and [!UICONTROL Client Secret] keys from the created project.

### Step 3: Enable the AdminAdobeIms module

The `AdminAdobeIms` module is responsible for the Adobe Commerce/Adobe IMS integration. After setting up the new project and copying your organization ID, client ID, and client secret, you can enable the `AdminAdobeIms` module.

Enter `bin/magento admin:adobe-ims enable`. You will be prompted to enter the following credentials. Use the values that were generated during project creation.

* Organization ID
* Client ID
* Client secret

Adobe Commerce displays a message indicating that enablement has succeeded or failed.

Once a new Adobe ID is created, customer information must be synced back to Adobe Commerce for authorization and access control.

### Step 4: Configure Adobe Commerce admins in the Adobe Admin Console

After successfully enabling this feature, you can transition other Adobe Commerce administrator accounts to Adobe administrator accounts.  Adobe Commerce admins must belong to at least one Adobe organization to log in using an Adobe ID.

1. In the Admin Console, navigate to [!UICONTROL Users]  > [!UICONTROL Users].
1. Click [!UICONTROL Add User].
1. Enter the email address of the user.
If applicable, the recommended ID Type is populated automatically. You can change this setting from the drop-down list.
The list of products that the drop-down list displays is based on your organization's purchase plan. You can add up to ten users at one time. To add more, repeat the preceding steps after saving your changes.
1. Click [!UICONTROL Save].
The administrator is added and is displayed in the Users list.
