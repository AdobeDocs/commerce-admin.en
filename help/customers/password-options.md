# Password Options

The customer password options determine the level of security that is used for password reset requests, the email templates that are used for customer notification, and the lifetime of the password recovery link. You can allow customers to change their own passwords or require that only store administrators can do so.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Customers]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Customer Configuration]**.

1. Expand the **[!UICONTROL Password Options]** section.

   |Column|Description|

   | By IP and Email | Check for previous attempts to reset password for specific email or from specific IP. |
   | By IP | Check for previous attempts to reset password from specific IP. |
   | By Email | Check for previous attempts to reset password for specific email. |
   | None | Protection disabled (no limits for resetting password). |
