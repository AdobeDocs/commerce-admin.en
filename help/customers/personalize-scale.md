# Personalization at scale

â€‹Personalization at scale allows businesses the ability to personalize the shopping experience for every customer touchpoint based on immediate context and previously observed behavior. The goal is to present the most relevant and personalized experience possible every time.

To understand the benefits of delivering a personalized shopping experience, download the [_Getting Started with Personalization at Scale_](https://business.adobe.com/resources/reports/getting-started-with-personalization-at-scale.html) report.

Creating a personalized shopping experience requires you to learn about the type of data needed to understand the customer context. From there, you learn about Adobe Commerce features that use that data to unlock the customer insights you need to create the personalized shopping experience.

The following image illustrates the concepts involved in personalizing the shopping experience:

This article discusses each of the above concepts in more detail.

## How do you personalize the shopping experience

Successful personalization starts with customer context. In this section, you learn about the data types that are available to help you build the customer context.

### Behavioral data

Behavioral data answers the question: How do shoppers interact with your site? For example:

- What products and categories are my shoppers most interested in?
- What kind of search queriers are my shoppers most engaged in?
- What is the order life cycle like? Are my shoppers returning products?
- Are my shoppers adding products to the cart and then abandoning it?
- Are my shoppers using a desktop or mobile browser?

While this list is not exhaustive, it helps us shed light on the diverse domains where behavioral information can be captured

### Customer profile data

Customer profile data answers the question: Who are your shoppers? For example, what is their:

- Name
- Gender
- Address
- Loyalty status
- Phone number
- Email address

### Segment data

Segment data answers the question: Which segments do your shoppers qualify for. For example, are they:

- Eligible for upgrades
- Cross-channel shoppers
- Prospects for new products
- Gold, silver, or bronze loyalty members

The above data forms the foundation of the Commerce customer context, which helps you know what products your customers are viewing and ultimately purchasing. You can then target their interests and personalize their experience.

In the next two sections, you learn how you can use this data in [Adobe Experience Platform](#using-commerce-data-in-adobe-experience-platform) and in [native Commerce features](#using-commerce-data-in-native-commerce-features) to personalize the shopping experience.

## Using Commerce data in Adobe Experience Platform

The Adobe Experience Platform provides a suite of technologies, that when hydrated with data from your Commerce store, can distribute that data through the Edge Network to other Adobe DX products to unlock insights into your shopper's buying behavior. With these deep insights, you can create a more personalized shopping experience across all channels.

To learn more about how you can send your Commerce data to the Experience Platform, see [Data Connection](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/overview.html).

In the following section, you learn how you can use native Commerce features, such as Product Recommendations and Live Search to create that personalized shopping experience. You will also learn about a feature called [!DNL Audience Activation], which uses data from a product available in the Experience Platform called Real-Time CDP. While Real-Time CDP is not native to Commerce, its information can be ingested into Commerce through the [[!DNL Audience Activation]](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/customers/audience-activation.html) extension.

## Using Commerce data in native Commerce features

Sitting on top of the customer context data in Commerce is the experience layer. This layer is composed of the Commerce features that can act on the context data and is divided into four main pillars:

- Product discovery
