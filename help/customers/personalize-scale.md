# Personalization at scale

Personalization at scale allows businesses to meet customer expectations and deliver customized experiences to every customer on every channel in real time. ​Personalization at scale means that your business has the ability to personalize any and every customer touchpoint based on immediate context and previously observed behavior. The goal is to present the most relevant and personalized experience possible every time, in real time.

## Key concepts

## How do you personalize the buying experience

Personalizing the buying experience for your shoppers hinges upon the ability to aggregate visitor data. Knowing what products your customers are viewing and ultimately purchasing, can help you target their interest and personalize their experience. This data is only useful if it can be shared between Commerce features.

In this section, you learn which features in Commerce understand the data so you can personalize your customers shopping experience.

### Out-of-the-box

These features are available on Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.

- **Dynamic blocks** - 
- **Cart price rules** - 
- **Segments** - 

### Merchandising services

Exclusively for Adobe Commerce merchants, the merchandising services feature set are optional Adobe Commerce extensions included in your license.

These features allow you to use behavioral data, product attributes, and inventory levels to automatically personalize product discovery across search results, product recommendations, and browsing pages, using Adobe Sensei AI for efficient merchandiser workflows.

- **Product Recommendations** - AI-fueled product recommendations based on shopper behavior, trends, product similarity and more. When combined with your Adobe Commerce catalog, product recommendations deliver a highly engaging, relevant, and personalized experience.

- **Live Search** - Uses the power of Adobe Sensei to personalize and optimize search results based on shopper's on-site actions, boosting search relevance and conversion. Use AI ranking algorithms to personalize and optimize search results in-session based on behavioral actions, boosting search relevance & conversion
- **Intelligent Merchandising** - Accessed from the Live Search Admin, intelligent merchandising uses AI to automatically re-rank the sequence of products on each category page to boost relevance and conversion for every shopper. You can create and manage AI-powered rules to automatically re-rank product sequencing on category pages according to shopper actions and affinities.

### Extending Commerce

You can extend the Adobe Commerce data sharing capabilities by connecting your Commerce instance to the Adobe Experience Platform. Connecting your Commerce instance to the Experience Platform unlocks the joint value Adobe Commerce can have with other DX Applications, including Real-Time CDP, Adobe Journey Optimizer (AJO), Customer Journey Analytics (CJA), Adobe Analytics (AA), and Adobe Target (AT). Use the Data Connection extension to send Commerce data to other Adobe Experience Cloud products and the Audience Activation extension to personalize the Commerce experience using Real-Time CDP Audiences.

- **Data Connection** - The [!DNL Data Connection] extension allows Adobe Commerce merchants to send [storefront](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/event-forwarding/events.html#storefront-events) and [back office](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-merchant-services/data-connection/event-forwarding/events.html#back-office-events) data to the Adobe Experience Platform edge so that other Adobe Experience Cloud products, such as Adobe Analytics and Adobe Journey Optimizer, can use that Commerce data. By connecting your Commerce data to other products in the Adobe Experience Cloud, you can perform tasks such as analyze user behavior on your site, perform AB testing, and create personalized campaigns.
- **Audience Activation** - Enables merchants to deliver personalized site content and promotions in real-time, tailored to AI-powered audiences built and managed within Real-Time CDP. The [!DNL Audience Activation] extension lets you activate Real-Time CDP audiences in Adobe Commerce to create unique offers in the cart. These offers and incentives include common ecommerce merchandising techniques, such as _buy 2 get 1 free_, hero banners geared toward that customer, and modified product pricing through various offers. The audiences built within Real-Time CDP are based on data from various enterprise systems, such as Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Customer Relationship Management (CRM), point of sale, and marketing systems. Because customer segment information is constantly refreshed, customers can become associated and disassociated from a segment as they shop in your store.
