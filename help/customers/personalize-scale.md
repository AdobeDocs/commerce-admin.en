# Personalization at scale

â€‹Personalization at scale allows businesses the ability to personalize the shopping experience for every customer touchpoint based on immediate context and previously observed behavior. The goal is to present the most relevant and personalized experience possible every time.

To understand the benefits of delivering a personalized shopping experience, download the [_Getting Started with Personalization at Scale_](https://business.adobe.com/resources/reports/getting-started-with-personalization-at-scale.html) report.

Creating a personalized shopping experience requires that you become familiar with the type of data needed to understand the shopper context. From there, you learn which features in Adobe Commerce use that data to unlock customer insights so you can create that personalized shopping experience.

This article discusses each of the above concepts in more detail.

## How do you personalize the shopping experience

Successful personalization starts with shopper context. Building an understanding of the customer context requires data. In this section, you learn what types of data are available to help you build that shopper context.

### Behavioral data

Behavioral data answers the question: how do shoppers interact with your site? For example, do they:

- Click a search ad
- Watch a video
- Interact with the call center
- Open an email offer
- Browse your site from a mobile device
- View specific products or categories
- Make purchases
- Return items

### Customer profile data

Customer profile data answers the question: who are your shoppers? For example, what is their:

- Name
- Gender
- Address
- Loyalty status
- Phone number
- Email address

### Segment data

Segment data answers the question: which segments do your shoppers qualify for. For example, are they:

- Eligible for upgrades
- Cross-channel shoppers
- Prospects for new products
- Gold, silver, or bronze loyalty members

The above data forms the foundation of the Commerce customer context, which helps you know what products your customers are viewing and ultimately purchasing. You can then target their interests and personalize their experience.

In the next section, you learn which features in Commerce can use this data to personalize the shopping experience.

## Commerce features that use customer context data to personalize the shopping experience
