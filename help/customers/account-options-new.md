1. Set each of the options according to the customer experience that you need to support on your storefront:

   - If you have a _Value Added Tax_ number and want it to be visible to customers, set **[!UICONTROL Show VAT Number on Storefront]** to `Yes`.

   - To require a customer's email during Admin order creation for a customer, set **[!UICONTROL Email is required field for Admin order creation]** to `Yes`.
