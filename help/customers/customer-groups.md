# Customer groups

Customer groups determine which discounts are available and the tax class that is associated with the group. The default customer groups are `General`, `Not Logged In`, and `Wholesale`.

## Create a customer group

>[!NOTE]
>
>Admin users that do not have access to all websites (assigned a role with a 'Custom' [!UICONTROL Role Scope]) cannot create, modify, or delete customer groups.

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Excluded Website(s)]** that you want to exclude from the group.

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >
   >Excluding websites can decrease product price and catalog rule indexing time, because excluded websites are not indexed. When a customer group is saved with an added website exclusion, the product price, catalog rule, and catalog search indexes are invalidated. If you have many products, websites, and customer groups, it is recommended that you pause the reindex process until you have excluded websites from the customer groups.

   No websites are excluded by default. To select multiple values, hold down the _Ctrl_ key (PC) or the _Command_ key (Mac) and click each option.
