# Create an individual customer account

Visitors to your store can open an account to manage their purchases and activities. Customers usually create their own accounts from your store. However, you can also create customer accounts directly from the Admin, which is useful for helping customers over the phone.

The following instructions represent the default customer account configuration. To change the selection and behavior of some of the fields in the form, see [Configuring Customer Accounts](../customers/customer-account-scope.md).

As a store administrator, you can also set the [new account options](../customers/account-options-new.md) to send a confirmation email to new registered customers, which helps to ensure that registered accounts are valid.

## Create account from the storefront

A store customer creates an account on the storefront.

1. From the storefront, clicks **[!UICONTROL Create an Account]** in the upper-right corner of the header.

   ![Create an Account](assets/storefront-create-an-account-link.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. Under **[!UICONTROL Personal Information]**, enters their **[!UICONTROL First Name]** and **[!UICONTROL Last Name]**.

   ![Personal Information](assets/storefront-create-account-personal-information.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. If they want to add their name and email address to the list of newsletter subscribers, the customer selects the **[!UICONTROL Sign Up for Newsletter]** checkbox.

   >[!INFO]
   >
   > This option appears even if the store doesn't publish a newsletter.

1. If they want store support staff to [see what they see](../customers/login-as-customer.md) and provide remote assistance, the customer selects the **[!UICONTROL Allow remote shopping assistance]** checkbox.

1. Under **[!UICONTROL Sign-in Information]**, enters their **[!UICONTROL Email]** address.

   >[!INFO]
   >
   > This email address becomes part of their sign-in credentials, and cannot be associated with any other customer account.

   ![Sign-in Information](assets/storefront-create-account-signin-information.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Enters a **[!UICONTROL Password]** that includes three of the following types of information:

   - Lowercase characters
   - Uppercase characters
   - Numbers
   - Special characters

   After they press **[!UICONTROL Enter]**, the strength of the password is evaluated and appears below the field. If the password is considered to be _Weak_, try another until it evaluated as _Strong_.

1. Then, the customer enters it again to **[!UICONTROL Confirm Password]**.

1. If needed, clicks **[!UICONTROL Show Password]** to view the password you entered.

The customer can then use their email address and password to [sign in](../customers/customer-sign-in.md) to their account and complete the address information.
