# Customer account scope

The header of every page in your store extends an invitation for shoppers to _Log in or register_ for an account with your store. Customers who open an account enjoy a range of benefits, including:

* **Create customer account** - Visitors can create a customer account so that they can use the storefront as a registered customer.
* **Create a company account** Depending on the configuration, a visitor to your store can choose to create a company account. For more information, see [B2B for Adobe Commerce](../b2b/introduction.md).
* **Faster checkout** — Registered customers move through checkout faster because much of the information is already in their accounts.
* **Self-service** — Registered customers can update their information, check the status of orders, and even reorder from their accounts.

Customers can access their account by clicking the **[!UICONTROL My Account]** link in the header of the store. From their account, customers can view and modify information, including past and current addresses, billing and shipping preferences, newsletter subscriptions, wishlist, and more.
