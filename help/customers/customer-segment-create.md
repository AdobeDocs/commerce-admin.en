# Creating and Deleting Customer Segments

{{ee-feature}}

Creating a customer segment is similar to building a [cart price rule](../merchandising-promotions/price-rules-cart.md), except that the options include [customer segment-specific attributes](../customers/customer-segments.md).

The following example shows how to create a customer segment that targets female customers in Los Angeles.

## Step 1: Enable Customer Segments

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to [!UICONTROL **Stores**]  > _Settings_ > [!UICONTROL **Configuration**].

1. In the left panel, expand [!UICONTROL **Customers**] and choose [!UICONTROL **Customer Configuration**].

1. Expand the [!UICONTROL **Customer Segments**] section.

1. Verify that [!UICONTROL **Enable Customer Segment Functionality**] is set to `Yes`.

1. When complete, click [!UICONTROL **Save Config**].

## Step 2: Add a Customer Segment

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to [!UICONTROL **Customers**] > [!UICONTROL **Segments**].

1. In the upper-right corner, click [!UICONTROL **Add Segment**].

1. Enter a [!UICONTROL **Segment Name**] to identify the customer segment when working in the Admin.

1. Enter a brief [!UICONTROL **Description**] that explains the purpose of the segment.

1. Set [!UICONTROL **Assigned to Website**] to the website where the customer segment can be used.

1. Set the [!UICONTROL **Status**] to _Active_ or _Inactive_.

1. To identify the customer types that you want to use for applying the segment, set [!UICONTROL **Apply to**] to one of the following:

   |Field|Description|
   | --- | --- |
   | Visitors and Registered Customers | Includes all shoppers, regardless of whether they are logged in to an account. |
   | Registered Customers | Includes only shoppers who are logged in to an account. |
   | Visitors | Includes only shoppers who are not logged in to an account. |

   {style="table-layout:auto"}

1. If you are creating a segment based on customer attributes stored in a customer account, it is a best practice to apply the segment to registered customers only.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Save and Continue Edit**].

1. Additional options become available in the left panel.

### Segment properties

|Segment Name| A name that identifies the segment for internal reference.|
|Description| A brief description that explains the purpose of the segment for internal reference.|

## Step 3: Define the conditions (Example)

1. In the left pane, click [!UICONTROL **Conditions**].

   The default condition begins, "If ALLÂ of these conditions are TRUE:".

1. Create a condition to target female customers:

   * Click the [!UICONTROL **Add**] icon to display the list of conditions and select `Gender`.

   * Leave the default **is** condition control option.

   * Click **...** and select `female`.

1. Create another condition that targets residents of Los Angeles:

   * On the next line, click the [!UICONTROL **Add**] icon and select `Customer Address`.

1. This creates a parent condition where you can define one or more address fields to match.

   * Click the [!UICONTROL **Add**] icon to display the list of address fields and select `City`.

   * Click **is** to display the condition control options and select `contains`.

   * Click **...** and enter `Los Angeles`.

   * On the next line, click the [!UICONTROL **Add**] icon and select `State/Province`.

   * Leave the default **is** condition control option.

   * Click **...** and select `United States > California`.

1. Click [!UICONTROL **Save and Continue Edit**].

## Step 4: Review the list of matched customers

1. In the left pane, click [!UICONTROL **Matched Customers**] to display all customers who match the condition.

   ![Matched customers](assets/customer-segment-matched-customers.png)

1. The customer segment can now be used for targeting promotions, content, and mailings.

## Delete a customer segment

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to [!UICONTROL **Customers**] > [!UICONTROL **Segments**].
