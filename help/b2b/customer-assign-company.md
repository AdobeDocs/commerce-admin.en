# Add customers to a company account

When enabled in the configuration, the company administrator adds users to the company. However, the company assignment of a customer profile can also be made or changed from the Admin.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If an individual already has a personal account with your store, and later goes to work for a company, do not assign the person's individual account to the company. Instead, create a company user account for the person with a company email address.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL All Customers]**.

1. Find the customer in the grid and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column.

1. In the left panel, choose **[!UICONTROL Account Information]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Associate to Company]** and type the first few letters of the company name in the input box.

   The system generates a list of all possible matches.

1. In the list, select the company where you want to assign the customer and click **[!UICONTROL Done]**.

1. If the customer was previously assigned to a different company, click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

   The customer is reassigned to the customer group (or [shared catalog](catalog-shared.md)) of the company and added to its [company structure](account-company-structure.md).

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Customer]**.

   The following columns are updated in the [Customers](../customers/customers-all.md) grid:

   - The _[!UICONTROL Group]_ column changes to the name of the customer group (or shared catalog) that is assigned to the company.
   - The _[!UICONTROL Company]_ column displays the name of the company to which the customer profile is now associated.
