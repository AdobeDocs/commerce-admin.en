# Add users to a company account

When enabled in the configuration, the company administrator adds and manages company users from the storefront. However, users can also be assigned to a company account from the Admin.

If needed, you can assign a user to more than one company. For example, if B2B buyers support multiple companies, you can add their user accounts to all companies they do business with. On the storefront, buyers that are assigned to multiple companies can switch between company accounts by selecting from the available companies in the [!UICONTROL Company] menu.

>If an individual already has a personal account with your store, and later goes to work for a company, do not assign the person's individual account to the company. Instead, create a company user account for the person with a company email address.
