# Add users to a company account

When enabled in the configuration, the company administrator adds users to the company in the storefront. However, users can also be assigned to a company account from the Admin.

If needed, you can assign a user to more than one company. For example, if B2B buyers support multiple companies, you can add their user accounts to all companies they do business with. On the storefront, buyers that are assigned to multiple companies can switch between company accounts by selecting from the available companies in the [!UICONTROL Company] menu.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If an individual already has a personal account with your store, and later goes to work for a company, do not assign the person's individual account to the company. Instead, create a company user account for the person with a company email address.

## Assign a user to one or more company accounts

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL All Customers]**.

   The [!UICONTROL Customers grid] shows a separate row for each company that the user is assigned to. The following columns are updated.

   - The _[!UICONTROL Group]_ column changes to the name of the customer group (or shared catalog) that is assigned to the company.
   - The _[!UICONTROL Company]_ column displays the name of the company to which the customer profile is now associated.
