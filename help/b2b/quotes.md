# Negotiable Quotes

Buyers and sellers use Quotes to manage the negotiation process for an order–adding items, updating quantities, requesting and applying discounts, and so on—until they reach agreement.

## Prerequisites

- [The B2B for Adobe Commerce extension is installed](install.md)
- [Configured B2B features](enable-basic-features.md)
  - Enable company accounts
  - Enable B2B quote


Quotes can be initiated by an authorized buyer from a company or a sales representative. After the quote is created, the negotiation process begins when the buyer or seller submits the quote for review. The _Quotes_ grid lists each quote received and maintains a history of the communication between buyer and seller. Use the standard [workplace controls](../getting-started/admin-workspace.md) to filter the list, change the column layout, save views, and export data.

- Buyers submit the quote as a [request to negotiate](quote-price-negotiation.md) the price from the shopping cart.

- Sales representatives can create a draft quote on behalf of a specific company buyer. Then, they update the draft quote to add products by SKU or product name, and other information to complete the initial offer before submitting the quote to the customer to initiate the negotiation process.

During the negotiation process, the quote can only be updated by the person reviewing and proposing terms for futher negotiation.

The _Quotes_ grid lists each quote received and maintains a history of the communication between buyer and seller. Use the standard [workplace controls](../getting-started/admin-workspace.md) to filter the list, change the column layout, save views, and export data.

## Quote workflow

Quotes can be initiated by the buyer or the seller.

**Step 1: Quote creation**

- **Buyer requests quote** - The buyer [requests a quote](quote-request.md) from the shopping cart. The request appears in the _My Quotes_ list in the account dashboard of the buyer and email notification is sent to the sales representative who is assigned to the company account. In the Admin, the request appears in the _Quotes_ grid, with a status of `New`. A request for a quote can be modified by the buyer until it is opened by the seller.

- **Sales representative** — A Sales Representative [creates a quote](sales-rep-initiates-quote.md) on behalf of a specific company buyer from the Admin. The new quote is in `Draft` status. The quote is visible only to the seller. The Sales Representative must update the quote to add products and add other information like discounts and notes to the buyer. After adding the terms, the Sales Representation submits the quote to the buyer to initiate the negotiation process. The quote status changes to `Submitted` and cannot be modified by the seller until the buyer sends it back.


**Step 2: Quote review and negotiation**

**Seller views request and sends response** - The seller views the request for a quote. The status of the quote changes to `Pending`, and the buyer cannot make any changes. The [seller responds](quote-price-negotiation.md) by offering discounted pricing for the products in the quote, enters a comment, and sends the quote back to the buyer. The buyer and sales representative are notified by email that the seller has responded.

**Buyer views quote from seller and sends response** - The buyer clicks the link in the email notification to open the quote, or opens the quote from the _My Quotes_ page of the account dashboard.

The buyer and seller can continue the negotiation process until an agreement is reached.

**Step 4: Buyer accepts quote** - The buyer accepts the proposed price and continues to checkout. Additional discounts cannot be added to the negotiated quote.

## B2B role resources for store quotes

Configuration options for quotes are controlled using the [role resources](../systems/permissions-user-roles.md#role-resources). These role resources must be set for the Admin user role that is assigned to the store administrator.

To grant access to quote functions in the Admin, go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > _[!UICONTROL Permissions]_ > **[!UICONTROL User Roles]**, select the role, and navigate to [!UICONTROL Sales] > [!UICONTROL Operations] > [!UICONTROL Quotes] in the _Role Resources_ tree.
