# Approve a company account

The status of requests received from the storefront to create a company are `Pending Approval` until the request is reviewed by the store administrator, and either approved or rejected. The status of a company account might be set to any of the following:

- [!UICONTROL Active]
- [!UICONTROL Pending Approval]
- [!UICONTROL Rejected]
- [!UICONTROL Blocked]

You can also use the [Actions control](account-company-manage.md) to approve multiple company requests.
