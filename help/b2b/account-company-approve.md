# Approve a Company Account

The status of requests received from the storefront to create a company are “Pending Approval” until the request is reviewed by the store administrator, and either approved or rejected. The status of a company account might be set to any of the following:

- [!UICONTROL Active]
- [!UICONTROL Pending Approval]
- [!UICONTROL Rejected]
- [!UICONTROL Blocked]

You can also use the [Actions control](account-company-manage.md) to approve multiple company requests. New company requests are easy to find, because they appear at the top of the list in the _[!UICONTROL Companies]_ grid.

## Approve a pending company account

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Companies]**.

   All pending requests appear at the top of the list. To make them more noticeable, you can adjust the grid layout to include the _[!UICONTROL Status]_ column.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column, click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Company Status]** to `Active`.

1. When prompted to confirm, click **[!UICONTROL Change status]**.

   The company administrator receives email notification that the company is now active.

1. If applicable, set **[!UICONTROL Sales Representative]** to a specific Admin user account.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png)  the **[!UICONTROL Account Information]** section and use the **[!UICONTROL Comment]** field to enter notes about the account.

   The comments are not visible from the storefront.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   A confirmation email is sent to the company and company administrator with instructions to set the account password.
