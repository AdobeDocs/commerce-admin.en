# Approve a Company Account

The status of requests received from the storefront to create a company are “Pending Approval” until the request is reviewed by the store administrator, and either approved or rejected. The status of a company account might be set to any of the following:

- Active
- Pending Approval
- Rejected
- Blocked

You can also use the [Actions control](account-company-manage.md) to approve multiple company requests. New company requests are easy to find, because they appear at the top of the list in the _Companies_ grid.

   All pending requests appear at the top of the list. To make them more noticeable, you can adjust the grid layout to include the _Status_ column.

1. In the _Action_ column, click **Edit**.

1. Set **Company Status** to `Active`.

   The company administrator receives notification that the company is now active.

1. If applicable, set **Sales Representative** to a specific Admin user account.

   The comments are not visible from the storefront.

   A confirmation email is sent to the company and company administrator with instructions to set the account password.
