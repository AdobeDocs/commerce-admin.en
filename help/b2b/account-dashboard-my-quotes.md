# [!UICONTROL My Quotes]

If quotes are enabled, the _[!UICONTROL My Quotes]_ section of the customer account dashboard lists all quotes submitted by the customer. Depending on their permissions, only buyers who make purchases on behalf of a company can submit requests to negotiate the price of a purchase.

The buyer begins the process by [submitting a request](quote-request.md) for a quote from the shopping cart. Email is exchanged between the buyer and seller during the [negotiation process](quote-price-negotiation.md). For the buyer, the [!UICONTROL My Quotes] page is the focal point for all communication between buyer and seller during the negotiation process. A buyer who accepts the negotiated price offered by the seller can proceed directly to the checkout page from the quote. Additional discounts cannot be added to the negotiated quote.

A buyer can complete the following actions when negotiating a quote:

* Review item pricing and updates
* Track the negotiation process from [!UICONTROL Comments] and [!UICONTROL History] sections
* Modify the quote to remove items
* Communicate and negotiate with the seller by adding notes at the line item and quote level
* Send quote to seller for review
* Convert the quote to an order if the terms are acceptable
* Close the quote
* Delete the quote
* [!BADGE 1.5.0-beta capabilities]{type=Informative url="/help/b2b/release-notes.md" tooltip="Available only for Beta program participants"} Rename the quote, create a copy of the quote

The following example shows a quote that has been updated by the buyer and sent back to the seller for review.

Quotes with the `Updated` status are locked until the seller returns the quote.
