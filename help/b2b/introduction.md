# Introduction to [!DNL B2B for Adobe Commerce]

Unlike the standard business-to-consumer model, integrated B2B (Business to Business) features are designed to meet the needs of sellers (Commerce merchants) who have customers that are companies. It accommodates companies with complex organizational structures and multiple users with various roles and levels of purchasing permission. A typical B2B customer might be the manager of a retail store, or a buyer that makes purchases on behalf of a company. In both cases, the transaction takes place between your business and theirs. You might also sell products direct to the consumer. [!DNL B2B for Adobe Commerce] is an integrated solution that provides support for both B2B and B2C models.

With the [installation](install.md) and [enablement](enable-basic-features.md) of the B2B extension in your Adobe Commerce store, the buying experience can be personalized with customer-specific catalogs and pricing, and targeted content and promotions.

## Company accounts

The Company component is the key entity within B2B on which all other features are in some way dependent. It allows joining multiple buyers that belong to the same company into a single company account (or corporate account). The company administrator is able to build the company structure (divisions, subdivisions, and users) in the appropriate hierarchy and provide different user roles and permissions to the company members. This hierarchy allows the company administrator to control user activity for the company account: ordering, quoting, purchasing, access to company credit information or profile, and so on. A seller can configure how the buying company operates on the website, including the payment methods, pricing levels, the ability to negotiate prices, and the ability to create requisition lists.

For more information, see [Company Accounts](account-companies.md).

>[!NOTE]

>When enabled, your store can give companies the option to _Pay on Account_, which means to make purchases on a company credit line. As the merchant, you can allocate credit for a company account and manage credit settings for a company, and credit reimbursement.

## Shared catalogs

Shared catalogs are the pricing levels that allow setting custom prices per product for different companies on one or multiple websites. By using shared catalogs, you can sell products by applying different pricing levels for different customer groups.

For more information, see [Working with Shared Catalogs](catalog-shared.md).

## Quick Order

Configure Quick Order to reduce the order process to several clicks for logged in customers when they know the product name or SKU of the products they want to order.

For more information, see [Quick Orders](quick-order.md).

## Negotiated quotes

Use the Quotes feature to allow authorized buyers to initiate the price negotiation process by submitting a request from the shopping cart. The _Quotes_ grid in the Admin lists each quote received, and maintains a history of the communication between buyer and seller.

For more information, see [Negotiated Quotes](quotes.md).
