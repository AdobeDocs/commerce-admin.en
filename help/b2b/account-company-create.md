# Create a Company Account

Company accounts can be set up from the storefront by the customer, or from the Admin. All requests to create a company account must be approved by the store administrator before the account becomes active.

The person who sets up a company account from the storefront is assigned a role as the [company administrator](account-company-admin.md). After the request to create a company account is approved, the company administrator can set an account password and log in to the account.

## Method 1: Customer creates the account from the storefront

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To support this method (allowing customers to register their company from the storefront), make sure that the [B2B Features](enable-basic-features.md) are configured so that **[!UICONTROL Allow Company Registration from the Storefront]** is set to `Yes`.

1. In the upper-right corner of the storefront header, the customer clicks **[!UICONTROL Create an Account]** and chooses **[!UICONTROL Create New Company Account]**.

   >If a visitor is logged in to a registered user account, they can create a company account by navigating to _[!UICONTROL Customer Profile]_ > **[!UICONTROL Company Structure]** > **[!UICONTROL Create a Company Account]**.
