# Create a Company Account

Company accounts can be set up from the storefront by the customer, or from the Admin. All requests to create a company account must be approved by the store administrator before the account becomes active.

The person who sets up a company account from the storefront is assigned a role as the [company administrator](account-company-admin.md). After the request to create a company account is approved, the company administrator can set an account password and log in to the account.

## Method 1: Customer creates the account from the storefront

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>To support this method (allowing customers to register their company from the storefront), make sure that the [B2B Features](enable-basic-features.md) are configured so that **Allow Company Registration from the Storefront** is set to `Yes`.

1. In the upper-right corner of the storefront header, the customer clicks **Create an Account** and chooses **Create New Company Account**.
