# Company account structure

A company account can be set up to reflect the structure of the business. Initially, the company structure includes only the company administrator, but can be expanded to include teams of users. The users can be associated with teams or organized within a hierarchy of divisions and subdivisions within the company.

In the company administrator's account dashboard, the company structure is represented as a tree and initially consists of only the company administrator.

When the account is created and approved, the company administrator can use the company email address or be assigned a different email address.

It is possible that the person who serves as company administrator has multiple roles within the company. If a separate email address is entered for the company administrator, the initial company structure includes the company administrator plus an individual user account in the name of the company administrator. In such a case, the company administrator can sign in to the account as the company or as an individual user.

For merchants, the full company structure is reflected in the _Companies_ and _Customers_ grids within the Admin. The Companies grid lists all companies regardless of status. The following example shows accounts for two companies: the _ACME_Â company and the _Vendelay_ company.

The following example shows the [!UICONTROL Customers] grid with the initial company administrator accounts for these companies.

After creating the account, the company administrator must define the company structure of [teams](account-company-structure.md), set up the [company users](account-company-users.md), and establish [roles and permissions](account-company-roles-permissions.md) for each.

## Create company teams

The structure of a company account should reflect the purchasing organization, whether it is simple and flat or a complex organization with different teams for each subdivision and division of the company.

If the store is [configured](enable-basic-features.md) to allow companies to manage their own accounts, setting up the company structure is one of the first tasks for a company administrator to complete after the account is approved. In the company account, the structure of the company is represented as a tree with the company administrator at the top.
