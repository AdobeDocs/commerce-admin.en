# Requisition Lists

Using a requisition list saves time when purchasing frequently ordered products because items are added to the shopping cart directly from the list. Customers can maintain multiple lists that focus on products from different vendors, buyers, teams, campaigns, or anything else that streamlines their workflow. It is available for both logged-in users and guests.

>[!NOTE]
>
>To enable requisition lists for your store, see [Enable Basic B2B Features](enable-basic-features.md). It can allow up to 999 requisition lists to be maintained for each customer account, depending on the [configuration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/customers/requisition-lists.html).

Requisition list functionality is similar to wish lists, with the following differences:

- A requisition list is not cleared after sending items to the shopping cart. It can be used multiple times.
- The user interface for requisition lists uses a compact view in order to display many items.
