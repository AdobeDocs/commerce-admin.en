# Company management

[!BADGE 1.5.0-beta]{type=Informative url="/help/b2b/release-notes.md" tooltip="Available only for Beta program participants"}

The Company management capability streamlines business operations for companies with complex organizational structures. Admin users can manage companies as a group by building a company hierarchy that assigns related companies to a designated parent company. This assignment allows the parent company administrator to manage their own account and the company accounts for all assigned companies.

1. In the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Companies]**.

1. Open the company detail page in the Companies grid for the parent company by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** action.

See the [Manage company accounts](account-company-manage.md) for more information on the Companies grid.

## [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy]

On initial company creation, the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] grid is empty when you expand it. After a company is created, Admin users with appropriate permissions can use the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] to build a parent company organization by editing the designated parent company and assigning related companies.

See [assign and unassign companies](assign-companies.md) for more information on available actions in the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] grid.
