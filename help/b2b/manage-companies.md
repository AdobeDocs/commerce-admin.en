# Company management

The Company management feature streamlines business operations for companies with complex organizational structures. Admin users can create a company hierarchy by assigning companies to a designated parent company.

The _[!UICONTROL Companies]_ page lists all current companies, regardless of status. The standard [workplace controls](../getting-started/admin-workspace.md) can be used to filter the list, change the [column layout](../getting-started/admin-grid-controls.md), save views, or export data.

The _[!UICONTROL Actions]_ control above the grid can be used to apply an action to multiple company line items. The actions that are available depend on the [permissions](../systems/permissions.md) for the role that is assigned to your Admin user account.

### Column descriptions

The **[!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy]** view provides information about any company relationships defined for the parent company. For example, on the detail page for a parent company, the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] displays all companies assigned to the parent.
