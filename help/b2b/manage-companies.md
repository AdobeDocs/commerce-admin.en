# Company management

The Company management feature allows company Administrators to view and manage the parent company and its internal organization with all related companies. Administrators will be able to assign or unassign companies to the parent company or manage the roles and permissions within those companies. B2B company management is an excellent opportunity to improve the performance within a company.

From a business point of view, the controlling or owning company is generally called a parent company. While many parent companies will completely own their related companies, they can also be just one of the owners or members as well. In most cases, however, the parent company will be the majority shareholder. Although those companies are connected, they are two distinct legal entities.

Each company contains unique identifiers, such as:

* Company ID
* Company name
* Company type
* Company email
* Phone number
* Country
* State/Province
* City
* Company admin

## Company Hierarchy

In the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Companies]**.

![Companies Grid](./assets/companies-grid.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

The [!UICONTROL Companies] grid lists all companies regardless of status. 

When a company administrator creates a new company, you can unfold a dropdown called **Company Hierarchy** where you can view the parent company, or [assign and unassign companies](assign-companies.md) to that parent company:

* New Parent Company: When the company administrator has created the company, new companies can be added to this parent company.
* Existing Company: When the company administrator has created the company, new companies can be searched and added to this parent company.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> In the **Company Hierarchy** view for a parent company, it appears as empty. This section enables a sales representative to identify all companies that are part of that parent company.

Once the [company account](account-company-create.md) is created and the company administrator and other users have been setup, you can specify the inheritance in the company management:

* Full Inheritance: Shared catalogs, quotes, payment and shipping methods are replicated from the parent company to its related companies.
* Partial Inheritance: Specify what is inherited from the parent company to its related companies.
* No Inheritance: No inheritance between the parent company and its related companies.
