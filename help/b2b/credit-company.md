# Manage Company Credit

If [Payment on Account](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/payment/payment-on-account.html) is enabled in the configuration, companies can make purchases on their account up to the credit limit that is granted to the company. When enabled, customers can check the status of their company credit from their account dashboard.

You can set the following credit-related parameters for each company profile:

- Credit Currency
- Credit Limit
- Allow to Exceed Credit Limit
- Reason for Change

If the company has an outstanding balance, a notice to the store administrator appears at the top of the sales order when it is viewed from the Admin. To learn more, see [Creating a Company Account](account-company-create.md).

## Company Credit activity

The Company Credit section of the company profile displays a summary of the customer credit activity, with a grid of the company credit history.

## Update the credit information

When the customer makes the payment for their outstanding credit to the merchant, a store administrator must then update the customer credit information in the Admin.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Customers > Companies**.

1. Find the company in the grid and open in _Edit_ mode.

1. Expand the **Company Credit** section.

1. For **Credit Limit**, enter the new value.

1. Change the other values as needed.

1. When updates are complete, Click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

## Receive Payments

A reimbursed balance is an offline payment that is made by a company toward the balance of their account. The store administrator enters the amount manually in the company profile, using the _Reimburse Balance_ button. When the amount is submitted, the system recalculates the outstanding balance and available company credit, and records the action in the company credit history. The reimbursed amount is entered in the credit currency, as specified in the configuration.

### Apply a payment to a company account

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Companies]**.

1. Find the company record in the list and open in **[!UICONTROL Edit]** mode.

1. At the top of the page, click **Reimburse Balance**.

1. Add the payment information:

   - Enter the **Amount** of the payment.

      The amount can be entered as a positive or negative value.

   - If applicable, enter the **Custom Reference Number** for reference.

      Only one custom reference number can be entered per reimbursement. To apply the payment to multiple POs, create a separate reimbursement for each.

   - As needed, enter a **Comment** to describe the reimbursement.

1. Click **Reimburse**.

   The companyâ€™s outstanding balance and available credit is recalculated, and the Company Credit history is updated to reflect the reimbursement.

## Storefront credit information

For the company administrator, the account dashboard displays the _Company Credit_ section. It provides the current outstanding balance, available credit, and the credit limit that is allocated to their company account followed by a list of outstanding invoices.

If the merchant cancels an order that was charged to company credit, the amount of the order is returned to the company balance and the _Credit Allocation History_ includes a record of the action.
