# Company management

The Company management capability streamlines business operations for companies with complex organizational structures. Admin users can manage companies as a group by building a company hierarchy that assigns related companies to a designated parent company. This assignment allows the parent company administrator to manage their own account and the company accounts for all assigned companies.

Build a company hierarchy from the Company detail page.

## Open the Company detail page

1. From the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Customers]** > **[!UICONTROL Companies]**.

1. Open the company detail page in the Companies grid for the parent company by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Edit]** action.

See the [Manage company accounts](account-company-manage.md) for more information on the Companies grid.

## [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy]

On initial company creation, the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] grid is empty when you expand it. After a company is created, Admin users with appropriate permissions can use the [!UICONTROL Company Hierarchy] to build a parent company organization by editing the designated parent company and assigning related companies.
