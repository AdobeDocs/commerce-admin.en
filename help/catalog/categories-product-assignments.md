# Category product assignments

For a category, use the _[!UICONTROL Products in Category]_ section to review the products that are currently assigned to the category. The search filters at the top of each column are used to add and remove products from the category. You can also use [category rules](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/category-product-rules.html) ( ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) Adobe Commerce only) to dynamically change the product selection when a set of conditions is met. To learn more, see [Visual Merchandiser](../merchandising-promotions/visual-merchandiser.md)).

>[!TIP]
>
>During category rule setup, the products are _sorted_, _matched_, _assigned_, and _unassigned_ according to that rule **_only_** when this category is saved. For example, if you add a product to the catalog and want to assign it according to the rule, you **must resave each category** that is set to match products by rule to ensure that the new product is assigned. Also, if any product stock status is changed to `In Stock` or `Out of Stock` and products in the category are _sorted_ according to the **Automatic Sorting** rule, you must click **[!UICONTROL Save Category]**.

>[!NOTE]

>The _Stock_ column displays salable product quantity for _**selected category scope**_ only. When multiple stocks are managed for products, you should switch between the corresponding scopes to display other _Stock_ column values in the _Category Products_ grid.

## Apply a category rule

{{ee-feature}}

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Match products by rule]** to `Yes`.

   The automatic sorting and condition options appear.

   ![To Match Products by Rule](./assets/category-match-products-by-rule.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Set the **[!UICONTROL Automatic Sorting]** order.

   This automatic sorting is based on current conditions.

   - `Stock level` - Move to top or bottom.
   - `Special price` - Move to top or bottom.
   - `New Products` - List newest products first.
   - `Color` - Sort alphabetically by color.
   - `Name` - Sort in ascending or descending order by Name.
   - `SKU` - Sort in ascending or descending order by SKU
   - `Price` - Sort in ascending or descending order by Price.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Condition]** and do the following:

   - Choose the **[!UICONTROL Attribute]** that is the basis of the condition.
   - Choose the **[!UICONTROL Operator]** that is needed to form the expression.
   - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Value]** that is to be matched.

   ![Add Condition to Category Rule](./assets/category-rule-create.png)<!-- zoom -->

   Repeat this process for each attribute that is needed to describe the conditions to be met. For example, to match products that were created from 7 through 30 days ago, do the following:

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Date Created]** to `Less than 30`.
   - Set **[!UICONTROL Logic]** to `AND`.
   - Set **[!UICONTROL Date Modified]** to `Greater than 7`.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Category]**.
