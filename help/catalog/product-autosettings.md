# Product settings - Autosettings

{{ee-feature}}

The Autosettings section includes any attributes that are dependencies for other operations. You can apply the default [RMA configuration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/rma-configure.html) setting to the product or override it, as needed.

With RMA, an Admin user has the ability to allow return functionality for specific products, as well as disallow the returning of specific products.
