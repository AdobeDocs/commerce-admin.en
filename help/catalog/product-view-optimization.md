# Product settings - [!UICONTROL Product View Optimization]

After using [Google Content Experiments](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/google-content-experiments.html) to set up a series of A/B tests, use the _[!UICONTROL Product View Optimization]_ section to paste the snippet of code from Google into the original product that is to be tested.

This section appears only if **[!UICONTROL Google Content Experiments]** is enabled in the [Google Analytics](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/google-universal-analytics.html) Google API configuration.
