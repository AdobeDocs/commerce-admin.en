# Product settings - [!UICONTROL Customizable Options]

Adding customizable options to a product is an easy way to offer a selection of options with text, selection, and date input types. Customizable options are a good solution if your inventory needs are simple. However, because they are based on variations of a single SKU, they cannot be used to manage stock or as the basis of price rule conditions. If you have multiple products with the same options, you can set up one product and import the options to the other products.

When a customer purchases a product with a customizable option, a description of each selected option appears below the product description, and any associated markup (or markdown) is automatically applied to the price of the item.

If a cart price rule is triggered by the purchase, the initial calculation applies first to the product price and secondarily to the line item price with any adjustment for applicable customizable options. In the following example, the customer purchases a duffle bag for $74.00, plus a customizable option for a monogram. A markup of $14.80 is applied to the base product price, and the adjusted price is shown as $88.80. In this case, the purchase of the duffle bag triggers a cart price rule based on the product SKU and applies a discount to the purchase, plus free shipping. Although the cart price rule is not triggered by the customizable option, it applies the discount to the cart contents, which includes the markup for the customizable option.
