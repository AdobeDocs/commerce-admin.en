# Flat catalogs

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Use of a flat catalog is no longer recommended as a best practice. Continued use of this feature is known to cause performance degradation and other indexing issues. A detailed description and solution is available in the [Help Center](https://support.magento.com/hc/en-us/articles/360034631192){:target="_blank"}.<br/><br/>Affected versions include: <br/>- Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, 2.3.x and above<br/>- Adobe Commerce (On-Premise), 2.3.x and above<br/>- Magento Open Source, 2.3.x and above <br/><br/>On any release version, some extensions only work with flat tables, thus creating a risk if you disable flat tables. If you know that you have some extensions that use Flat Catalog indexers, you need to be aware of this risk when setting those values to `No`.

Commerce typically stores catalog data in multiple tables, based on the Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) model. Because product attributes are stored in many tables, SQL queries are sometimes long and complex.

In contrast, a flat catalog creates tables on the fly, where each row contains all the necessary data about a product or category. A flat catalog is updated automaticallyâ€”either every minute, or according to your cron job. Flat catalog indexing can also speed up the processing of catalog and cart price rules. A catalog with as many as 500,000 SKUs can be indexed quickly as a flat catalog.

### Method 2: Verify the results for a category

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Categories]**.
