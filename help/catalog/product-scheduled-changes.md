# Schedule product updates

{{ee-feature}}

Product updates can be applied on schedule and grouped with other content changes. You can use [content staging](../content-design/content-staging.md) to create a campaign based on scheduled changes to the product, or apply the changes to an existing campaign.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The [!UICONTROL Set Product as New From] and [!UICONTROL To] fields and [!UICONTROL Schedule Design Update] tab have been removed in ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) Adobe Commerce and cannot be modified directly on the product. You must create a scheduled update for these activations.

>[!NOTE]
>
>All scheduled updates are applied consecutively, which means that any entity can have only one scheduled update at one time. Any scheduled update is applied to all store views within its time frame. As a result, an entity cannot have different scheduled updates for different store views at the same time. All entity attribute values within all store views, which are not affected by the current scheduled update, are taken from the default values, and not from the previous scheduled update.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A staging preview for a scheduled update always starts from the **default** store view, which emulates the customer's experience of navigating through the staging update campaign.

## Create a scheduled update

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]**.

1. Select an existing product and click **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Schedule New Update]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Save as a New Update]**.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Update Name]**, enter a name for the new content staging campaign.

1. Enter a brief **[!UICONTROL Description]** of the update and how it is to be used.

1. Use the Calendar (![calendar icon](../assets/icon-calendar.png)) tool to choose the **[!UICONTROL Start Date]** and **[!UICONTROL End Date]** for the campaign.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Campaign **[!UICONTROL Start Date]** and **[!UICONTROL End Date]** must be defined by using the **_default_** Admin time zone, which is converted from the local time zone for each website. For example, with multiple websites in different time zones where you want to start a campaign based on a US time zone, you must schedule a separate update for each local time zone. Set **[!UICONTROL Start Date]** and **[!UICONTROL End Date]** for each, and it is converted from the local website time zone to default Admin time zone.

## Schedule a design update

{{ce-feature}}

The _[!UICONTROL Schedule Design Update]_ section gives you the ability to make temporary changes to the appearance of the product page. You can schedule design changes for a season, promotion, or just to make things fresh. Design changes can be scheduled in advance, so they go into effect, or _drip_, on your defined schedule.
