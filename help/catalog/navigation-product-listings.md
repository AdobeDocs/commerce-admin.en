# Product listings

Product listings can be set to appear by default as either a list or grid. You can also determine how many products appear per page, and which attribute is used to sort the list. Each catalog page with a product list has a set of controls that can be used to sort the products, change the format of the list, sort by attribute, and advance from one page to the next.

## Configure product listings

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel, expand **Catalog** and choose **Catalog** underneath.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Storefront** section.

   See also [_Storefront_](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/catalog/catalog.html)

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >To correctly display products and their prices according to _product sorting by price_, make sure that the settings for the price display in the [Sales Tax configuration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/sales/tax.html) have the same value (`Excluding Tax` **or** `Including Tax`). For the _Calculation Settings_, check the **Catalog Prices** value. And for _Price Display Settings_, check the **Display Product Prices in Catalog** value. If these have different values, price filters in the layered navigation may not properly filter and sort products by price.

1. Set the default **List Mode** to one of the following:

    - `Grid Only`
    - `List Only`
    - `Grid (default) / List`
    - `List (default / Grid`

1. For **Products per Page on Grid Allowed Values**, enter the number of products that you want to appear per page when shown in grid format.

   To enter a selection of values, separate each number by a comma.

1. For **Products per Page on Grid Default Value**, enter the default number of products to appear in the grid per page.

1. For **Products per Page on List Allowed Values**, enter the number of products that you want to appear per page when shown in list format.

   To enter a selection of values, separate each number by a comma.

1. For **Products per page on List Default Value**, enter the default number of products that appear in the list, per page.

1. Set **Product Listing Sorted by** to the default attribute that is initially used to sort the list.

1. To give customers the option to list all products, set **Allow All Products on Page** to `Yes`.

1. If you want to retain all pagination settings as customers browse through catalog listings, set **Remember Category Pagination** to `Yes`.

   Enabling this setting ensures that the number of products displayed in a list or grid is retained as shoppers browse from one category to another. By default, this field is set to `No` because it uses more cache storage and can impact the way pages are indexed by search engines.

1. If using a [flat catalog](catalog-flat.md) (**not recommended**), do the following:

   - To display a flat category listing of products, set **Use Flat Catalog Category** to `Yes`.

   - To display a flat product listing, set **Use Flat Catalog Product** to `Yes`.

1. If you want to allow dynamic references for media assets in category and product URLs, set **Allow Dynamic Media URLs in Products and Categories** to `Yes`.

1. When complete, click **Save Config**.

## Pagination controls

The Pagination settings appear at the top and bottom of the list, and control the format of the pagination links for product listings. You can set the number of links that appear in the control, and configure the Next and Previous links. For the pagination links to appear, there must be more products in the list than are allowed per page in the product list configuration.
