# Categories - Search Engine Optimization settings

The _[!UICONTROL Search Engine Optimization]_ section specifies the [URL Key](catalog-urls.md) and [metadata](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/meta-data.html) fields that are used by search engines to index the category. Although some search engines ignore meta keywords, others continue to use them. The current [SEO best practice](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/seo-best-practices.html) is to incorporate high-value keywords in both the meta title and meta description.

|Field|[Scope](../getting-started/websites-stores-views.md#scope-settings)| Description |
|--- |--- |----------------------------------------------------|
|[!UICONTROL URL Key]|Store View| Determines the online address of the category page. The URL key is added to the base URL of the store, and appears in the address bar of a browser. In the configuration, you can either include or exclude the category URL key in the product URL. The URL Key should be all lowercase characters, with non-trailing hyphens between these characters instead of spaces. Do not include a suffix such as .html, because it is managed in the configuration. |
|[!UICONTROL Meta Title]|Store View| The title appears in the title bar and tab of your browser, and is also the title on a search engine results page (SERP). The meta title should be unique to the page and s in length. |
|[!UICONTROL Meta Keywords]|Store View| Relevant keywords for the category. Consider using keywords that customers might use to find products in the category. |
|[!UICONTROL Meta Description]|Store View| The meta description provides a brief overview of the page for search results listings. An ideal length is between 150-160 characters in length, with a maximum of 255 characters. Although not visible to the customer, some search engines include the meta description on the search results page. |
