# Advanced pricing

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source support various pricing options that you can use for promotions, or to meet the minimum advertised pricing requirements of the manufacturer. Changes to product pricing can be made on schedule, or by price rule that is applied at the product level or in the shopping cart.

Manage prices for your products with advanced pricing to offer customers better rates that encourage consumers to spend more, drive the traffic to your site, and clear old stock.

The _[!UICONTROL Advanced Pricing]_ settings define the conditions required for special pricing that is available for a specific customer group or shared catalog. Advanced pricing can be applied to simple, virtual, downloadable, and bundle products. To apply discounted pricing to other product types, use a [catalog price rule](../merchandising-promotions/price-rules-catalog.md). For more information, see [Price Scope](catalog-price-scope.md).

Advanced pricing data is synchronized with product pages. For example, if you update a tier price quantity, the system updates the value on the product page.

![B2B for Adobe Commerce](../assets/b2b.svg) (Available with [B2B for Adobe Commerce](./b2b/../introduction.md) only) If you are using shared catalogs, advanced pricing data is synchronized with both product pages and shared catalogs. For example, if you update a tier price quantity, the system updates the value in the shared catalog and on the product page. Any custom pricing that is indicated in the shared catalog has priority over customer group pricing. Also refer to [Set shared catalog pricing and structure](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/b2b/shared-catalogs/define/catalog-shared-pricing-structure.html) in the _B2B for Adobe Commerce Guide_.
