# Categories - Content settings

The _Content_ settings determine any additional content appears on the category page. In addition to the list of category products, the page can include an image, description, and CMSÂ block. You can use the [Page Builder](../page-builder/introduction.md) content tools to define the category description.

## Add the category description in Page Builder

1. Open the category in edit mode.

1. Scroll down and expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Content** section.

   ![Category content](./assets/category-content.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. At the top-right of the **Description** area, click **Edit with Page Builder**.

1. Use the [Page Builder](../page-builder/introduction.md)  content tools to [edit any existing text](../page-builder/text.md) and add other content (if needed).

## Page Builder preview

When you expand the _Content_ section for an existing category where there is content created with Page Builder, it displays a preview of the **Description** content as it would appear in the category page. Click the content area to open the Page Builder workspace, where you can make any needed updates.

![Description preview](../page-builder/assets/pb-product-category-content-preview.png)<!-- zoom -->

This content preview is enabled for the product and category forms by default. If performance suffers due to loading the preview, you can disable the preview in the [Content Management configuration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration/general/content-management.html#advanced-content-tools) settings.

## Add the category description in the editor

Enter only plain ASCII characters into the text box. If pasting text from a word processor, save it first as a plain .TXT file to remove any invisible control characters.

For more information, see [Using the Editor](../content-design/editor.md).

1. Open the category in edit mode.

1. Scroll down and expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Content** section.

   ![Category content](./assets/category-content-ce.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Enter the category **Description** and use the [editor toolbar](../content-design/editor.md) to format as needed.

   You can drag the lower-right corner to change the height of the text box.

## Add a CMS block to the category page

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Catalog** > **Categories**.

1. In the category tree, select the category that you want to edit.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Content** section.

1. For **Add the CMS block**, select a block you want to add.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Display Settings** section.

1. Set the **Display Mode** to one of the following:

   - `Static block only`
   - `Static block and products`

1. When complete, click **Save** and review the block display on the storefront (requires cache refresh).
