# Assign Sources per Product

Before modifying quantities and settings, you must assign [sources](sources-manage.md) to the products.

{{$include /help/_includes/unassign-source.md}}

## Assign sources to a product

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Catalog]** > **[!UICONTROL Products]**.

1. Open a product in _Edit_ mode.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** section.

   This section allows you to modify the source, update inventory quantities, and more.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Currently, only Simple, Configurable, Virtual, Downloadable, and Grouped products support multiple sources. Bundle products can be created and managed with only the Default Source and Stock.
