# Assign quantities per product

After adding [sources](sources-assign-per-product.md), update the inventory quantities for your product. These values track the on-hand, available stock amounts.

To hide a source's inventory from shipments without removing the source, set _[!UICONTROL Source Item Status]_ to `Out of Stock`. The SSA and shipment options only access sources listed as `In Stock` with available inventory quantity.

All updated quantities and sources display in the product grid.

1. Locate and open a product in edit mode.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Sources]** section.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Source Item Status]** to `In Stock`.
