# Add a Source

Manage inventory and order fulfillment from multiple locations with custom sources. Create a source for each location such as warehouses, brick-and-mortar stores, distribution centers, and drop shippers. Assign sources and update quantities per product

If editing the Default Source, you can edit all configurations except name and code. It is recommended that single-source merchants add information matching their location.

## Add an inventory source

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Inventory]_ > **[!UICONTROL Sources]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add New Source]**.

   ![Manage Sources](assets/inventory-sources.png)

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL General]** section and do the following:

    - To identify the inventory source, enter a unique **[!UICONTROL Name]**.

    - Enter a unique **[!UICONTROL Code]**.

      The code supports upper and lower case letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores. The code is a unique ID used when assigning to stock and exporting-importing data.

    - If this inventory source is ready to use, set **[!UICONTROL Is Enabled]** to `Yes`.

    - Enter a brief **[!UICONTROL Description]** for this location for quick reference or additional details.
