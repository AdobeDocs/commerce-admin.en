Inventory Management 1.2.4 (module version: `magento/inventory-metapackage = 1.2.4`) is supported with version 2.4.4 and compatible with version 2.4.0 of Magento Open Source, Adobe Commerce, and Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure.

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Commerce now displays an accurate salable quantity value for all products in the Admin product list view. Previously, it displayed a blank value for salable quantity of in-stock products with SKUs that contained special characters. <!--- MC-41936-->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Performance has improved for cart-and-checkout actions such as adding products to the cart in deployments with many (approximately 10,000) inventory sources. <!--- MC-42570-->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) The `bin/magento inventory:reservation:list-inconsistencies` command now handles orders with partial shipments correctly even if the reservations are missed from the database and the cache has been cleared. Previously, when this command was executed with a pre-cleared cache, Commerce displayed the following error: `Area code is not set`. <!--- MC-42142-->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Incremental indexing of grouped product child products no longer causes other grouped products to be incorrectly indexed when children are shared. <!--- MC-41963-->

[GitHub-30053](https://github.com/magento/magento2/issues/30053)  <!--- MC-41545-->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Adobe Commerce no longer creates a duplicate product reservation after a credit memo is updated by API. <!--- MC-41757-->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Saleable product quantity and in-stock product quantity are now synced correctly. Previously, inventory reservation compensation was not recreated for canceled orders. <!--- MC-42485-->

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Added a Bulk Partial Stock Transfer Endpoint** - Current bulk transfer endpoints move all assigned quantity from an origin to a destination source. The new `/rest/V1/inventory/bulk-partial-source-transfer` endpoint allows merchants to transfer partial stock from source to source as a bulk operation. To transfer a specific amount of quantity, enter a request to the endpoint with the `sku`, `qty`, `origin_source_code`, and `destination_source_code`. Transfers verify that the source is assigned to the `sku`, enough quantity exists to transfer, and so on. See [Inventory Bulk Actions](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/rest/modules/inventory/bulk-inventory.html){target="_blank"} in the REST API documentation. <!-- https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2117 -->

See the [CLI reference](cli.md) for more information. <!-- https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2199 https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2184 https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2171 https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2148  -->

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Performance improvements for sources and SSA options** -  Sorting and selecting sources during shipment caused performance degradation for stocks with high numbers of sources.

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Added GraphQL support for Inventory Management** - This release installs a new `magento/module-inventory-graph-ql` module. The GraphQL [ProductInterface attributes](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.4/graphql/interfaces/product-interface.html){target="_blank"} now includes the `only_x_left_in_stock` and `stock_status` attributes for [!DNL Inventory Management] support. <!-- https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2124 -->

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Simplified UI for Assigned Sources** - The Assigned Sources table in product pages has simplified content for easier updates and increased performance when displaying many sources. All sources list by source name (hover over for `source_code`).

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Export Aggregated Stock Service** - This release provides a new export-aggregated stock service (retaining reservations in the system) to support external Sales Channels, such as Amazon, eBay, and Google Shopping ads.  <!-- https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/2067 -->

This update resolves a [known issue](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.3.0OpenSource.html#known-issues) in version 2.3.0 of Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce. See [Set up Elasticsearch service](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/project/services-elastic.html){target="_blank"} for installation information. <!-- PR https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/1943 -->

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Resolved performance issues with Default Stock to drastically increase performance with numerous operations. Improvements increase performance for single-source mode, Transfer Inventory to Source, Storefront Category pages, and Salable Quantity calculations. This update resolves a [known issue](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/release-notes/ReleaseNotes2.3.0OpenSource.html#known-issues){target="_blank"} requiring custom stocks creation for single-source merchants in version 2.3.0 of Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce.

![Fixed issue](../assets/fix.svg) Resolved issues with Out of Stock status and bulk Inventory Transfer to Stock for configurable and grouped products. Selecting the parent products and performing bulk actions does not affect the product status. If the parent product was In Stock, it remains In Stock.

<!-- PR https://github.com/magento/inventory/pull/1972 -->

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Distance Priority Algorithm** â€” The Distance Priority Algorithm is a new, out-of-the-box Source Selection Algorithm for distance-based shipping recommendations. This algorithm compares the location of the shipping destination address with source locations to determine the closest source to fulfill shipments. The distance may be determined by either physical distance or the time spent traveling from one location to another, using imported geocode location data or Google directions (driving, walking, or bicycling).

![New](../assets/new.svg) **Expanded source quantity list** â€” Merchants with a high number of sources can easily hover and view all sources per product through the Product Grid. Each product displays a minimum of five sources and matching quantities. When hovering over the sources, you can scroll through the entire list of sources and current quantities.

![Known issue](../assets/bug.svg) Known issue with Magento Open Source and Adobe Commerce v2.3.1 - Asynchronous migration of data between sources encounters issues due to changes in Asynchronous APIs with topic names reflecting PHP class and method names. Using synchronous operations, setting **[!UICONTROL Run asynchronously]** to `No`, is recommended.
