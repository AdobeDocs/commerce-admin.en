# Directives Caution

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Inserting many directives, especially widgets like the _Recently Viewed_ / _Compared Products_ type, can produce a negative effect on the first load of the page when it is not cached. For this reason, use them with caution. Usually, it does not create an issue. But you should discuss this potential issue with your development team.
