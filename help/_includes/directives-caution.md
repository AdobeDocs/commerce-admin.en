# Directives Caution

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Inserting many directives, especially widgets like the Recently Viewed / Compared Products type, can produce a negative effect on the first page load when the page is not cached. For this reason, we advise that you use them with caution. In most cases, it should not create an issue. But this is something that you should discuss with your development team.
