>**Disabled feature:** Backup is disabled by default. Enabling this function may require developer assistance. See the following Installation Guide topic to enable backups: [Back up and roll back the file system, media, and database](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/tutorials/backup.html).

>**Deprecation notice** Backup features are deprecated as of v2.3.0. We recommend that all merchants investigate additional backup technologies and binary backup tools (such as [Percona XtraBackup](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup).
