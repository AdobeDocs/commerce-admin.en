# USPS API type configuration options

>[!NOTE]
>
>These instructions include steps to select the USPS API type for integration: Web Tools API or REST APIs. The API type configuration options are available only if you have applied the [USPS REST API Migration quality patch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-knowledge-base/kb/troubleshooting/known-issues-patches-attached/usps-rest-api-migration-patch.html)(AC-1520) to your Commerce application. If you have not applied the patch, the API type selector is not available, and the USPS Web Tools API is used by default.<br>The USPS APIs are the preferred method for integrating with USPS. The USPS Web Tools API is deprecated and may be removed in future releases.
