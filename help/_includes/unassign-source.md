# Unassign sources

>[!NOTE]
>
>Unassigning a source clears all quantity data. Reassigning a source can potentially cause issues with salable quantities, reservations, and pending orders. We recommend processing all orders prior to unassigning sources, or other source changes. You can also use new commands to detect and update reservations. See [[!DNL Inventory Management] CLI Reference](../inventory-management/cli.md) for more information.
