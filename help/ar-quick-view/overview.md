# [!DNL AR Quick View] for Adobe Commerce

The [!DNL AR Quick View] for Adobe Commerce module powers a seamless experience designed to display rendered 3D graphics for the user.

This guide provides an overview of the onboarding experience for the [!DNL AR Quick View] in Adobe Commerce and how the [!DNL AR Quick View] benefits the user, as well as best practices to follow along that journey.

Augmented reality (AR) describes user experiences that add 2D or 3D elements to the live view from a device's camera in a way that makes those elements appear to inhabit the real world.

Developed by Pixar, [Universal Scene Description (USD)](https://www.pixar.com/usd){target=_blank} is the first open-source software that can robustly and scalably interchange 3D scenes that may be composed of many different assets, sources, and animations, while fostering highly collaborative workflows. This USD is used within `.USDZ` schemas. This `.USDZ` schemas delivers AR and 3D content to the user's devices.

## Types of Augmented Reality (AR)

Image Tracking, when a 2D images is found by the camera, it's possible to show some kind of content on top of it, or near it. The content can be a 2D image, a GIF, a 3D model (also animated) and a 2D video too. Cases of use: Augmented Art, learning (Augmented books), Augmented flyers, advertising, etc.

Location Based AR, this kind of AR uses real-world places in order to show Augmented Reality content, on the user device. The experiences that can be built with this library are those that use a user's position in the real world. The user can move (ideally outdoor) and through their smartphones they can see AR content where places are in the real world. Moving around and rotating the phone will make the AR content change according to users position and rotation (so places are 'anchored' in their real position, and appear bigger/smaller according to their distance from the user). With this solution it's possible to build experiences like interactive support for tourist guides, assistance when exploring a new city, find places of interest like buildings, museums, restaurants, hotels and so on. It's also possible to build learning experiences like treasure hunts, and biology or history learning games, or use this technology for situated art (visual art experiences bound to specific real world coordinates).

Marker Tracking, When a marker is found by the camera, it's possible to show some content (same as Image Tracking). Markers are very stable but limited in shape, color and size. It is suggested for those experiences where are required a lot of different markers with different content. Examples of use: (Augmented books), Augmented flyers, advertising.
