# PayPal Payments Standard

[PayPal Payments Standard][4] is the easiest way to accept payments online. You can offer your customers the convenience of payment both by credit card and PayPal by simply adding a checkout button to your store.

>[!NOTE]
>
>For merchants outside the US, it is called _PayPal Website Payments Standard_.

With PayPal Payments Standard, you can swipe credit cards on mobile devices. There is no monthly fee and you can get paid through eBay. Supported credit cards include Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express. In addition, customers can pay directly from their personal PayPal accounts. PayPal Payments Standard is available in all countries on the PayPal worldwide reference list.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>**PSD2 Requirements:** <br/>
>As of September 14, 2019, European banks might decline payments that do not meet [PSD2](../getting-started/compliance-payment-services-directive.md) requirements. No action is needed for PayPal Payments Standard to comply with PSD2 because all requirements are handled by PayPal.

## Merchant requirements

- [PayPal Business Account][1]

## Checkout workflow

For customers, PayPal Payments Standard is a one-step process if the credit card information on their personal PayPal accounts is up to date.

1. **Customer Places Order** - The customer clicks/taps the _Pay Now_ button to complete the purchase.

1. **PayPal Processes the Transaction** - The customer is redirected to the PayPal site to complete the transaction.

## Set up PayPal Payments Standard

>[!NOTE]
>
>PayPal Payments Standard cannot be used simultaneously with any other PayPal method, including Express Checkout. If you change payment solutions, the one used previously is disabled.

>[!TIP]
>
>Click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]** at any time to save your progress.

### Step 1: Begin the configuration

This setup method assumes you have an existing PayPal account.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Sales]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Payment Methods]**.

1. If your Commerce installation has multiple websites, stores, or views, set **[!UICONTROL Store View]** to the store view where you want to apply this configuration.

1. In the _[!UICONTROL Merchant Location]_ section, select the **[!UICONTROL Merchant Country]** where your business is located.

   This setting determines the selection of PayPal Solutions that appear in the configuration.

   When your connection is validated, you can proceed.

   If you do not have a PayPal account, click **[!UICONTROL Start accepting payments via PayPal]**.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL API Authentication Methods]** to one of the following:
