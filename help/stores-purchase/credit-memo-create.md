# Issue a credit memo

Before a credit memo can be printed, it must first be generated for an [invoiced order](invoices.md#create-an-invoice). You can issue both online and offline refunds (partial or full) from an open credit memo, depending on the payment method.

- ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) Refunds can be applied to store credit.
- ![Adobe Commerce B2B](../assets/b2b.svg) (Available with Adobe Commerce B2B) Refunds can be applied to company credit.
- Purchases made by credit card can be refunded either online or offline.
- Purchases made by check or money order must be refunded offline.

Any credit memo with an [open status](order-status.md) has an outstanding refund due.

With credit memos you can:

- Refund the full amount of an invoice.
- Refund a partial amount of an invoice.
- Refund multiple partial amounts of an invoice.
- Refund multiple invoices per order, not to exceed the total order amount.
- Refund a portion of the quantity for one line item, such as three of the five shirts in an order.

See [Create an invoice](invoices.md#create-an-invoice) for more information.

## Payment action setting

The refund workflow for orders paid by credit card is determined by the [Payment Action setting](../configuration-reference/sales/payment-methods.md#payment-actions) in the configuration for each available payment method. Refunds cannot be issued until the transaction is settled.

![Payment Action setting](./assets/payment-action-setting.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

- If the Payment Action for your configured payment method is set to `Authorize`, you must first generate the invoice from the Admin before a credit memo can be created.
- If Payment Action for your configured payment method is set to `Authorize and Capture`, the invoice has already been generated by the payment processor, but the funds aren't available until the transaction is settled. This brief waiting period is recommended by many payment processors as a security measure, and can usually be handled automatically. Transactions can also be settled manually from your merchant account with the payment processor.
- ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) If you create a credit memo for an order that includes gift options, the refund for the gift wrapping and/or printed card appears in the Refund Totals section of the credit memo. To exclude these costs from the amount to be refunded, enter the amount as an Adjustment Fee. If multiple credit memos are issued for the same order, the refund for gift options appears in only the first credit memo.

## Create a credit memo

Determine the type of refund that you want to issue---for a [credit purchase](#issue-a-refund-for-a-credit-purchase) or for [check or money order](#issue-an-offline-refund-for-check-or-money-order)---and generate the credit memo and issue a refund.

### Issue a refund for a credit purchase

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Sales]** > **[!UICONTROL Orders]**.

   ![Orders grid](./assets/orders-grid.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. Find the order in the grid, and click **[!UICONTROL View]**.

1. If the _[!UICONTROL Credit Memo]_ button is visible in the button bar, do one of the following:

   - To issue an `offline` refund, go to step #6.
   - To issue an `online` refund, continue with step #4.

   See [Credit Memos](credit-memos.md) for more information about offline and online refunds.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Invoices]** in the left panel.

1. Find the invoice in the grid and click **[!UICONTROL View]**.

   ![Invoices grid](./assets/order-invoices-grid.png){width="700" zoomable="yes"}

1. Scroll down to the **[!UICONTROL Invoice Totals]** section of the invoice, verify that the invoice is set to `Capture Online`, and click **[!UICONTROL Submit Invoice]**.

   ![Capture Online](./assets/order-invoice-capture-online.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   If that option isn't available, the invoice is already created. Proceed to the next step.

1. In the button bar at the top of the invoice, click **[!UICONTROL Credit Memo]**.

1. Verify the information in the **[!UICONTROL Items to Refund]** section and do the following, if applicable:

   - To return the product to inventory, select the **[!UICONTROL Return to Stock]** checkbox.

      The product returns to stock automatically if _Product Stock Options_ is set to `Automatically Return Credit Memo Item to Stock`. With [Inventory Management enabled](../inventory-management/enable.md), the item returns to the source that sent the shipment.

   - Update the **[!UICONTROL Qty to Refund]**, and click **[!UICONTROL Update Qty's]**.

      ![Items to Refund](./assets/invoice-credit-memo-items-to-refund.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. Update the **[!UICONTROL Refunds Totals]** section as follows:

   - For **[!UICONTROL Refund Shipping]**, enter any amount that is to be refunded from the shipping fee.

      This field initially shows the total shipping amount from the order that is available for refund. It is equal to the full shipping amount from the order, less any shipping amount that has already been refunded. Like the quantity, the amount can be reduced, but not increased.

   - For **[!UICONTROL Adjustment Refund]**, enter a value to be added to the total amount refunded as an extra refund that does not apply to any particular part of the order (shipping, items, or tax). It can also be used for partial refund with virtual money, such as a gift card, when an administrator wants to refund a non-virtual payment method first.

      The amount entered cannot raise the total refund higher than the paid amount.

   - For **[!UICONTROL Adjustment Fee]**, enter a value to be subtracted from the total amount refunded.

      This amount is not subtracted from a specific section of the order such as shipping, items, or tax.

1. To add a comment, enter the text in the **[!UICONTROL Credit Memo Comments]** box.

   - To send an email notification to the customer, select the **[!UICONTROL Email Copy of Credit Memo]** checkbox.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Update Totals]**.

1. Do the following, as applicable:

   - ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) To refund the amount to the customer's store credit, select the **[!UICONTROL Refund to Store Credit]** checkbox.

   - ![Adobe Commerce B2B](../assets/b2b.svg) (Available with Adobe Commerce B2B) To refund the amount to the customer's company credit, select the **[!UICONTROL Refund to Company Credit]** checkbox.

   - To issue on offline refund, click **[!UICONTROL Refund Offline]**.

   - To issue an online refund, click **[!UICONTROL Refund]**.

   - ![Adobe Commerce B2B](../assets/b2b.svg) (Available with Adobe Commerce B2B) If the purchase was paid with company credit, click **[!UICONTROL Refund to Company Credit]**.

   See [Credit Memos](credit-memos.md) for more information about offline and online refunds.

   ![Items to Refund](./assets/credit-memo-items-to-refund.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   - Select the **[!UICONTROL Return to Stock]** checkbox if you want to return the returned product to inventory.

      With Inventory Management enabled, the inventory quantity returns to the source that sent the shipment. The product returns to stock automatically if [Product Stock Options](../inventory-management/enable.md) is set to `Automatically Return Credit Memo Item to Stock`.

   - Update the **[!UICONTROL Qty to Refund]** and click **[!UICONTROL Update Qty's]**.

      The amount to be credited cannot exceed the maximum amount that is available for refund.

1. Update the **[!UICONTROL Refunds Totals]** section as applicable:

   - For **[!UICONTROL Refund Shipping]**, enter any amount that is to be refunded from the shipping fee.

      This field initially displays the total shipping amount from the order that is available for refund. It is equal to the full shipping amount from the order, less any shipping amount that has already been refunded. Like the quantity, the amount can be reduced, but not increased.

   - For **[!UICONTROL Adjustment Refund]**, enter a value to be added to the total amount refunded as an extra refund that does not apply to any particular part of the order (shipping, items, or tax).

   - To include the comments that you have entered in the email, select the **[!UICONTROL Append Comments]** checkbox.

      The status of a credit memo notification appears in the completed credit memo next to the credit memo number.
