# Compare products

Compare Products generates a detailed, side-by-side comparison of two or more products. Depending on the theme, the Add to Compare link might be represented by an icon or text. The _Compare Products_ block usually appears in either the left or right sidebar of a catalog page.

Unlike the [Recently Viewed / Compared Products ](products-viewed-compared.md) block, the Admin does not include additional configuration settings for Compare Products.

## Compare products on the storefront

There are a few ways to use comparison list on the storefront.

### From catalog pages

1. The customer finds the products that they want to compare and clicks the **Add to Compare** link for each.

1. Navigates to an associated category page.

   Depending on the theme and page layout, there might be a _Compare Products_ block in the sidebar. If so, the items in the category that are marked for comparison are listed.

   The customer can click _Delete_ ( ![Delete icon](../assets/icon-delete-x.png) ) for any product to remove it from the comparison report, or click **Clear All** to remove all items and start over with your compare selections.

1. Clicks **Compare**.

1. To print the comparison information, clicks **Print This Page**.

1. To remove a single product from the comparison page, clicks _Delete_ ( ![Delete icon](../assets/icon-delete-x.png) ).

### From a notification message

1. After a customer adds a product to a comparison list, the page displays a notification message.

1. In the displayed top message notification, click the _comparison list_ link.
