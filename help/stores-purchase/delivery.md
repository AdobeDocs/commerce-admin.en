# Shipping and delivery

Studies show that stores offering customers a choice of several delivery methods have higher conversion rates than stores that use a single method. You can set up various delivery methods and shipping carriers. The [shipping settings](shipping-settings.md) establish the point of origin for all shipments made from your store or warehouse and your preference for managing orders shipped to multiple addresses. You can easily create [shipping labels](shipping-labels.md) for new and existing orders from the Admin of your store. Labels can be produced when a shipment is created, or later. Shipping labels are stored in PDF format and downloaded to your computer.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Due to the shutdown of Temando, support for [!DNL Magento Shipping] is removed in 2.4.0. For detailed status information and recommendations for new shipping implementations in Commerce, see the [product information](https://business.adobe.com/products/magento/shipping.html){:target="_blank"} page.

## Basic delivery methods

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source support a wide range of delivery methods, and shipping carriers. There are some basic delivery methods that do not require an account with a third-party provider:

* [Free Shipping](shipping-free.md)

* [Flat Rate](shipping-flat-rate.md)

* [Table Rates](shipping-table-rate.md)

* [In-Store Delivery](shipping-in-store-delivery.md)

   If you are using [Inventory Management](../inventory-management/introduction.md), you can also set up sources to provide in-store delivery options for your customers.

## Shipping carriers

If you have a commercial account with one or more [supported carriers](carriers.md), you can offer your customers the convenience of real-time shipping rates, package tracking, and labels. Built-in carrier integrations include UPS, USPS, DHL, and FedEx.
