# Create shipping labels

To create shipping labels, you must first set up your shipping carrier account to support labels. Then, follow the prompts to enter a description of the package and its contents.

After you configure the shipping label information and submit an order, Commerce connects to the shipping carrier system, submits an order, and receives a shipping label and a tracking number. If a shipping label for this shipment exists in the system, it is replaced with a new one. However, existing tracking numbers are not replaced. Any new tracking number is added to the existing one.

## Step 1: Contact your shipping carriers

Before you begin, make sure that your shipping accounts are set up to process labels. Some carriers might charge an extra fee to add shipping labels to your account.

Contact each carrier that you use to activate shipping labels for your store.

Follow the instructions provided by each carrier to add shipping label support to your account.

- **FedEx** - Contact [FedEx Web Integration Services][1] to learn about the label printing requirements for your account.
- **USPS** - Refer to the [Web Tools API Portal][4] under Shipper Support Center to learn how to set up your label printing credentials.
- **UPS**- Contact [UPS][2] to confirm that your account supports shipping labels. To generate shipping labels, you must use the UPS XML option.
