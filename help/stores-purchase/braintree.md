# Braintree

Braintree offers a fully customizable checkout experience with fraud detection, PayPal integration, Apple Pay, Google Pay, ACH, Venmo and Local Payment Methods. Braintree reduces the PCI compliance burden for merchants because the transaction takes place on the Braintree system.

If you are upgrading to 2.4.x from an earlier version of Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source with the Braintree extension from Commerce Marketplace installed, see the [2.4 upgrade notes](#24-upgrade-notes) at the end of this topic.

      `company*myproduct`
      
      The first part of the descriptor identifies the company or DBA, and the second part identifies the product. The length of the Company  and Product parts of the descriptor can be allocated in the following ways, for a combined length of up to 22 characters.
      
      **_Characters in Name descriptor_**
      
      _Option 1:_ Company must be three characters, Product may be up to 18 characters

      `(999) 999-9999`
      
      `999.999.9999`

   - **[!UICONTROL URL]** - The URL descriptor represents your domain name, and can be up to 13 characters long. For example:

      `company.com`

1. When your Braintree configuration is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

## 2.4 upgrade notes 

Before upgrading to Commerce 2.4, we recommended that merchants replace the core Commerce Braintree integration with the official Braintree extension from [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). Beginning with Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.4.0, the Braintree extension is included in the release.

If you are migrating to Commerce 2.4.x from a pre-2.4.0 version that has the Marketplace Braintree extension installed, you must uninstall that extension (`paypal/module-braintree` or `gene/module-braintree`) and update any code customizations to use the `PayPal_Braintree` namespace instead of `Magento_Braintree`. Configuration settings from the core Commerce Braintree Payments bundled extension and the extension distributed on Commerce Marketplace persist and payments placed with those previous versions can still be captured, voided, or refunded as normal.
