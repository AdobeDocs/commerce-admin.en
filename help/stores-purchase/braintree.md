# Braintree

Braintree offers a fully customizable checkout experience with fraud detection and PayPal integration. Braintree reduces the PCI compliance burden for merchants because the transaction takes place on the Braintree system.

If you are upgrading to 2.4.x from an earlier version of Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source with the Braintree extension from Commerce Marketplace installed, see the [2.4 upgrade notes](#24-upgrade-notes) at the end of this topic.

## Step 1: Get your Braintree credentials

Go to [Braintree Payments][1] and sign up for an account.

## Step 2: Complete the basic settings

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Sales]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Payment Methods]**.

   - If your Commerce installation has multiple websites, stores or views, in the upper-left corner, choose the **[!UICONTROL Store View]** where the configuration applies.

   - In the _Merchant Location_ section, verify that **[!UICONTROL Merchant Country]** is set to the location of your business.

1. Under Recommended Solutions, in the **[!UICONTROL Braintree]** section, click **[!UICONTROL Configure]** and do the following:

   ![Configure Braintree](../configuration-reference/sales/assets/payment-methods-braintree.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - Enter a **[!UICONTROL Title]** to identify Braintree as a payment option during checkout.

   - Set the current operating **[!UICONTROL Environment]** for Braintree transactions to one of the following:

      - `Sandbox`
      - `Production`

     When testing the configuration in a sandbox, use only [credit card numbers][2] that are recommended by Braintree. When you are ready to go to production with Braintree, set **[!UICONTROL Environment]** to `Production`.

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Payment Action]** to one of the following:

     -  `Authorize Only` - Approves the purchase and puts a hold on the funds. The amount is not withdrawn from the customer's bank account until the sale is _captured_ by the merchant.|
     - `Intent Sale`  - The amount of the purchase is authorized and immediately withdrawn from the customer's account. **_Note:_** This was  _Authorize and Capture_ in 2.3.x and earlier releases.|

   - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Merchant ID]** from your Braintree account.

   - Enter the following credentials from your Braintree account:

      - **[!UICONTROL Public Key]**
      - **[!UICONTROL Public Key]**

     ![Basic Settings](./assets/braintree-settings1.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Enable this Solution]** to `Yes`.

   - To include PayPal as a payment option with Braintree, set **[!UICONTROL Enable PayPal through Braintree]** to `Yes`.

   - If you want the ability to store customer information securely, so customers don't have to reenter it each time they make a purchase, set **[!UICONTROL Vault Enabled]** to `Yes`.

     ![Basic Settings](./assets/braintree-settings2.png)<!-- zoom -->

## Step 3: Complete the advanced settings

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Advanced Braintree Settings]** section.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Vault Title]**, enter a descriptive title for your reference that identifies the vault where your customer card information is stored.

1. Enter the **[!UICONTROL Merchant ID]** from your Braintree account.

1. To use Braintree fraud protection for all transactions, set **[!UICONTROL Advanced Fraud Protection]** to `Yes`.

   Ensure that the Advanced Fraud Protection is enabled in the Settings/Protection section of your account.

1. Set the `Bypass Fraud Protection Threshold` so that the `Advanced Fraud Protection` checks are bypassed when the threshold is met or exceeded.

1. Leaving this field blank disables this option.

1. If you want the system to save a log file of interactions between your store and Braintree, set **[!UICONTROL Debug]** to `Yes`.

1. To require customers to provide the three-digit security code from the back of a credit card, set **[!UICONTROL CVV Verification]** to `Yes`.

   If using CVVÂ verification, make sure to enable AVS and/or CVV in the _Settings/Processing_ section of your Braintree account.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Credit Card Types]**, select each credit card that is accepted by your store as payment through Braintree.

   To select multiple card types, hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and click each option.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Sort Order]**, enter a number to determine the sequence in which Braintree appears when listed with other payment methods during checkout.

   - Set the **[!UICONTROL Country]** and choose each **[!UICONTROL Allowed Credit Card Type]**.

   - Repeat to identify the credit cards that are accepted from each country.

## Step 5: Complete the PayPal through Braintree settings

1. Identify your PayPal through Braintree configuration:

   - Enter a **[!UICONTROL Title]** to identify Braintree's payment by PayPal option during checkout.

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Vault Title]** to `Yes` to enable use of a secure vault to store customers' credit card information.

   - For **[!UICONTROL Sort Order]**, enter a number to determine the sequence in which Braintree's PayPal payment option appears when listed with other payment options during checkout.

   - To display your [merchant name](../getting-started/store-details.md#store-information) differently than what is defined in your store configuration, enter the name as you want it to appear in the **[!UICONTROL Override Merchant Name]** field.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Payment Action]** to one of the following:

   - `Authorize Only` - Approves the purchase and puts a hold on the funds. The amount is not withdrawn from the customer's bank account until the sale is _captured_ by the merchant.
   - `Authorize and Capture` - The amount of the purchase is authorized and immediately withdrawn from the customer's account.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Payment from Applicable Countries]** to one of the following for Braintree transactions processed by PayPal:

   - `All Allowed Countries` - Customers from all [countries](../getting-started/store-details.md#country-options) specified in your store configuration can use this payment method.
   - `Specific Countries` - After choosing this option, the _[!UICONTROL Payment from Specific Countries]_ list appears. Hold down the Ctrl key (PC) or the Command key (Mac) and select each country in the list where customers can make purchases from your store.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >This feature must be enabled for your account by PayPal Technical Support.

1. To save a log file of interactions between your store and PayPal through Braintree, set **[!UICONTROL Debug]** to `Yes`.

1. If you want to bypass the Order Review step before the order is submitted, set **[!UICONTROL Skip Order Review]** to `Yes`.

   By default, Order Review is the last stage of the checkout process.

1. To display the PayPal button on both the mini shopping cart and shopping cart page, set **[!UICONTROL Display on Shopping Cart]** to `Yes`.

   ![PayPal through Braintree Settings](./assets/braintree-paypal.png)<!-- zoom -->

## Step 6: Complete the 3D verification settings

1. If you want to add a verification step for customers using credit cards that are enrolled in a verification program such as "Verified by VISA," set **[!UICONTROL 3D Secure Verification]** to `Yes`.

   During the process, the transaction amount that is submitted for verification is checked against the amount that is sent for authorization.

1. For **[!UICONTROL Threshold Amount]**, enter the minimum order amount that is required to trigger 3D verification.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Verify for Applicable Countries]** to one of the following:

   - `All Allowed Countries` - Customers from all [countries](../getting-started/store-details.md#country-options) specified in your store configuration can use this payment method.

## Step 7: Dynamic descriptors

The following descriptors are used to identify purchases on customer credit card statements. You can reduce the number of charge backs by clearly identifying the company that is associated with each purchase. If dynamic descriptors are not enabled for your account, contact Braintree support.

1. Enter the dynamic descriptor for the **[!UICONTROL Name]**, **[!UICONTROL Phone]**, and **[!UICONTROL URL]** according to these guidelines:

   -  **[!UICONTROL Name]** - There are two parts to the Name descriptor, which are separated by an asterisk (*). For example:
      
      `company*myproduct`
      
      The first part of the descriptor identifies the company or DBA, and the second part identifies the product. The length of the Company  and Product parts of the descriptor can be allocated in the following ways, for a combined length of up to 22 characters.
      
      **_Characters in Name descriptor_**
      
      _Option 1:_ Company must be three characters, Product may be up to 18 characters
      
      _Option 2:_ Company must be seven characters, Product may be up to 14 characters
      
      _Option 3_: Company must be 12 characters, Product may be up to nine characters

   - **[!UICONTROL Phone]** - The Phone descriptor must be 10 â 14 characters in length, and can include only numbers, dashes, parentheses, and periods. For example:

      `9999999999`
      
      `(999) 999-9999`
      
      `999.999.9999`

   - **[!UICONTROL URL]** - The URL descriptor represents your domain name, and can be up to 13 characters long. For example:

      `company.com`

1. When your Braintree configuration is complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

## 2.4 upgrade notes 

Before upgrading to Commerce 2.4, we recommended that merchants replace the core Commerce Braintree integration with the official Braintree extension from [Commerce Marketplace](https://marketplace.magento.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=braintree). Beginning with Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2.4.0, the Braintree extension is included in the release.

If you are migrating to Commerce 2.4.x from a pre-2.4.0 version that has the Marketplace Braintree extension installed, you must uninstall that extension (`paypal/module-braintree` or `gene/module-braintree`) and update any code customizations to use the `PayPal_Braintree` namespace instead of `Magento_Braintree`. Configuration settings from the core Commerce Braintree Payments bundled extension and the extension distributed on Commerce Marketplace persist and payments placed with those previous versions can still be captured, voided, or refunded as normal.
