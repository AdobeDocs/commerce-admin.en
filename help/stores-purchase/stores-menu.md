### Settings

Manage the hierarchy of [websites, stores, and store views](stores.md#store-and-site-structure) in your Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source installation, and all [configuration settings](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/configuration-overview.html). In addition, you can set up the [Terms and Conditions](terms-and-conditions.md) of a sale, and manage [order status settings](order-status.md#custom-order-status).

### Inventory

[Manage and create stocks](../inventory-management/introduction.md) to link your sales channels or websites to [sources](../inventory-management/sources-manage.md). Stocks provide an aggregated salable quantity of products. Single Source merchants use the Default Stock while Multi Source merchants use additional custom stocks.

### Taxes

Manage all types of [tax functions](taxes.md) across your store, set up the tax rules for your store, define customer and product tax classes, and manage tax zones and rates. You can also import tax rate data into your store.

### Currency

Manage the rates for the [currencies](currency.md) that are accepted as payment in your store and customize the currency symbols that appear in product prices and sales documents.

### Attributes

Manage [attributes](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/attributes.html) that are used for customer or product information, returns, and product ratings. You can create new attributes, edit existing attributes, and manage attribute sets.

### Other Settings

Manage additional settings for [reward exchange rates](../merchandising-promotions/reward-exchange-rates.md), [gift wrapping](cart-configuration.md#gift-wrap), and [gift registries](../merchandising-promotions/gift-registries.md).
