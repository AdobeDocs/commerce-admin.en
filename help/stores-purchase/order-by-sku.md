# Order by SKU

{{ee-feature}}

A 'SKU' is a 'Stock Keeping Unit'. SKUs generally help online sellers identify the most important product characteristics such as: size, color, price, and material. Product IDs are different from SKUs:

   - The `Product ID` is sequential series of numbers that are used internally to identify products and are not available to customers.
   - The `SKU` is generated by the seller, normally based on the product name and attributes for marketing or internal tracking. For example: A blue, cotton T-shirt, size medium: T-COT-MED-BL. The SKU may be changed by the seller if necessary.

Normally, a SKU includes a set of abbreviations indicating the distinguishing characteristics of the product. The maximum SKU length is 64 characters. SKUs are important to effectively track and manage inventory, so setting them up correctly is critical for e-commerce.

_Order by SKU_ is a [widget](../content-design/widgets.md) that can be displayed in the store as a convenience for all shoppers, or made available to only those in specific customer groups. Shoppers can either enter the SKU and quantity information directly into the Order by SKU block, or upload a csv file from their customer account. Regardless of the configuration, order by SKU is always available to store administrators.
