# Returns storefront experience

{{ee-feature}}

Customers can use either of the following to request an RMA from the storefront:

- [Orders and Returns Widget](../content-design/widget-orders-returns.md) in the sidebar
- _Orders and Returns_ link in footer

As a best practice, make sure to include a description of your RMA requirements and process in the Customer Service policy.

>[!NOTE]

>If you want to collect additional information related to returns, you can add your own custom [returns attributes](attributes-returns.md).
