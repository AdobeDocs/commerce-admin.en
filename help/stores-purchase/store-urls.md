# Store URLs

Each website in an Adobe Commerce or Magento Open Source installation has a base URL that is assigned to the storefront, and another URL that is assigned to the Admin. Adobe uses variables to define internal links in relation to the base URL, which makes it possible to move an entire store from one location to another without updating the links. Standard base URLs begin with `http`, and secure base URLs begin with `https`.

- **Base URL** — `http://www.yourdomain.com/magento/`
- **Secure Base URL** — `https://www.yourdomain.com/magento/`
- **URL with IP address** — `http://###.###.###.###/magento/` or `https://###.###.###.###/magento/`

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Do not change the Admin URL from the default base URL configuration. To change the Admin URL or path, see [Use a custom Admin URL](#use-a-custom-admin-url).

## Use a secure protocol

The base URLs for your store were initially set up during your Adobe Commerce installation. If a security certificate was available at the time, you could specify for `HTTPS` URLs to be used for the store, Admin, or both. If your Adobe Commerce installation includes multiple stores or you plan to later add more stores, you can include the store code in the URL. All Adobe resources and operations can be used with secure protocol.

If a security certificate was not available for the domain at the time of the installation, make sure to update the configuration before launching your store. After a security certificate is established for your domain, you can configure either or both base URLs to operate with encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and [Transport Layer Security][1] (TLS) protocol.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Adobe strongly recommends transmitting all pages of a production site, including content and product pages, using a secure protocol.

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source can be configured to deliver all pages over `HTTPS` by default. If your store has been running up with standard protocol, you can improve security by enabling [HTTP Strict Transport Security][2] (HSTS) and upgrading any unsecure page requests. HSTS is an opt-in protocol that prevents browsers from rendering standard `HTTP` pages that are transmitted with unsecure protocol for the specified domain. Because search engines might have already indexed each page of your store with standard `HTTP` URLs, you can configure Commerce to upgrade any unsecure page requests to `HTTPS` automatically , so you don't lose any traffic. When Commerce is configured to use secure URLs for both the storefront and Admin, two additional fields appear that allow you to enable `HSTS`.

## Configure the base URL

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. Under _General_ in the left panel, choose **[!UICONTROL Web]**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Base URL]** section.

   - **[!UICONTROL Base URL]** — Enter the fully qualified base URL for your store. Make sure to end the URL with a forward slash, so it can be extended with additional URL Keys from your store. For example: `http://yourdomain.com/`

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >Do not change the placeholder in the _[!UICONTROL Base Link URL]_ field. It is a placeholder that is used to create relative links to the base URL.

   - **[!UICONTROL Base URL for Static View Files]** — (Optional) Specify an alternate location for the base URL for static view files by entering the path starting with the following placeholder:

      \{\{unsecure_base_url}}

   - **[!UICONTROL Base URL for User Media Files]** — (Optional) Specify an alternate location for the base URL for user media files by entering the path starting with the following placeholder:

      \{\{unsecure_base_url}}

      For a typical installation, there is no need to update the paths for the static view files or media files because they are relative to the base URL.

   ![General configuration - web base URLs](../configuration-reference/general/assets/web-base-urls.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Placeholders enclosed in double braces are markup tags for variables.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

## Configure the secure base URL

If your domain has a valid security certificate, you can configure the URLs of both the storefront and Admin to transmit data over a secure (https) channel. Without a valid security certificate, your store cannot operate with secure (SSL/TLS) protocol.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the _[!UICONTROL Base URLs (Secure])_ section and do the following:

   ![General configuration - secure base URLs](../configuration-reference/general/assets/web-base-urls-secure.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

   - **[!UICONTROL Secure Base URL]** — Enter the full secure base URL, followed by a forward slash. For example: `https://yourdomain.com/`

   - **[!UICONTROL Secure Base Link URL]** — Do not change the placeholder in the secure base link URL field. It is used to create relative links to the secure base URL.

   - **[!UICONTROL Secure Base URL for Static View Files]** — (Optional) Specify an alternate location for the secure base URL for static view files by entering the path starting with the following placeholder:

        \{\{secure_base_url}}

   - **[!UICONTROL Secure Base URL for User Media Files]** — (Optional) Specify an alternate location for the secure base URL for user media files by entering the path starting with the following placeholder:

        \{\{secure_base_url}}

1. To enhance security, set both of the following options to `Yes`.

   - **[!UICONTROL Use Secure URLs on Storefront]**
   - **[!UICONTROL Use Secure URLs in Admin]**

1. For _[!UICONTROL Enhanced Security Settings]_, do the following:

   - **[!UICONTROL Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)]** — If you want your store to display only secure HTTPS page requests, set to `Yes`.

   - **[!UICONTROL Upgrade Insecure Requests]** — To upgrade any requests for standard unsecured HTTP pages to secure HTTPS, set to `Yes`.
      
1. Set the **[!UICONTROL Offloader Header]** for your server.

   Most Commerce installations use the default `X-Forward-Proto` to identify the protocol as either `HTTP` or `HTTPS`. If your server configuration uses a different offloader_header, enter it here.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

## Include the store code in URLs

>[!NOTE]
>
>When the _Add Store Code to URLs_ option is set to `Yes`, you must include store codes in your browser URLs. This setting ensures that URL rewrites are mapped correctly and all pages are opened successfully, without _"404 Page Not Found"_ errors.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. Under _[!UICONTROL General]_ in the left panel, choose **[!UICONTROL Web]**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL URL Options]** section.

1. Set **[!UICONTROL Add Store Code]** to your preference:

   - **[!UICONTROL URL with Store Code]**: `http://www.yourdomain.com/magento/[store-code]/index.php/url-identifier`
   - **[!UICONTROL URL without Store Code]**: `http://www.yourdomain.com/magento/index.php/url-identifier`

    ![General configuration - web URL options](../configuration-reference/general/assets/web-url-options.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

1. Click the **[!UICONTROL Cache Management]** link in the message at the top of the workspace. Then, follow the instructions to refresh the cache.

   ![Cache management message](./assets/msg-cache-management.png)

## URL troubleshooting

If after following the configuration instructions, some pages continue to be served with the unsecure URL (`http://`), do the following:

- Change the (unsecure) base URL to the secure HTTPS URL.
- On the server, edit the `.htaccess` file (or load balancer) so the unsecure URL is redirected to the secure URL.

## Use a custom Admin URL

As a [security best practice](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/implementation-playbook/best-practices/launch/security-best-practices.html), Adobe recommends that you use a unique Admin URL instead of the default _admin_ or a common term such as _backend_. Although it does not directly protect your site from a determined bad actor, it can reduce exposure to scripts that try to gain unauthorized access.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Check with your hosting provider before implementing a custom Admin URL. Some hosting providers require a standard URL to meet firewall protection rules.

In a typical installation, the Admin URL and path immediately follow the base URL. The Admin path is one directory below the root.

- **Default Base URL**: `http://yourdomain.com/magento/`
- **Default Admin Path**: `admin`
- **Default Admin URL and Path**: `http://yourdomain.com/magento/admin`

Although it is possible to change the Admin URL and path to another location, any mistake removes access to the Admin, and must be corrected from the server.

>[!NOTE]
>
>As a precaution, do not try to change the Admin URL yourself unless you know how to edit configuration files on the server. For Adobe Commerce projects deployed on cloud infrastructure, change the Admin URL by following the [instructions](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/env/stage/variables-admin.html?lang=en#admin-url) in the *Adobe Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure Guide*.

### Method 1: Change from the Admin

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Admin]**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Admin Base URL]** section.

1. Set the configuration options for the custom URL:

   ![Advanced configuration - Admin base URL](../configuration-reference/advanced/assets/admin-admin-base-url.png){width="600" zoomable="yes"}

    If needed, clear the **[!UICONTROL Use system value]** checkbox to change the setting.

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Use Custom Admin URL]** to `Yes`.

   - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Custom Admin URL]**: `http://yourdomain.com/magento/`

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The Admin URL must be in the same Commerce installation, and have the same document root as the storefront.

   - Set **[!UICONTROL Custom Admin Path]** to `Yes`.

   - For **[!UICONTROL Custom Admin Path]**, enter the path to use as the custom admin folder name.

      Example: `sample_custom_admin`

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.

1. After the changes are saved, sign out of the Admin and log back in using the new Admin URL and path.

### Method 2: Change the Admin path from the server command line

1. Open the `app/etc/env.php` file in a text editor, and change the value of the `frontName` parameter of the `backend` section. Then, save the file.

   Make sure to use only lowercase characters.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >   This method allows you to change the Admin Path, but not the Admin URL.

   >[!TIP]
   >
   >For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, you can set up a custom admin path using the `ADMIN_URL` variable in the Cloud UI. See the [Admin variables topic](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-cloud-service/user-guide/configure/env/stage/variables-admin.html) in the _Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure Guide_.

   - **Default Admin Path**

      ```php?start_inline=1
      'backend' => [
       'frontName' => 'admin'
      ],
      ```

   - **New Admin Path**

      ```php?start_inline=1
      'backend' => [
          'frontName' => 'backend'
      ],
      ```

1. Use one of the following methods to clear the cache:

   - On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > _[!UICONTROL Tools]_ > **[!UICONTROL Cache Management]**. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Flush Magento Cache]**.
   - On the server, execute the following:

      ```terminal
      php bin/magento cache:flush
      ```

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >The changes made using the Method 1 have the priority over the changes made in the `app/etc/env.php` file.

### Method 3: Change the Admin path using the Commerce CLI

You can use the CLI `setup:config:set` command to change the Admin Path. The following example uses the `--backend-frontname` option to change the path from the Commerce root to a new Admin path:

```terminal
bin/magento setup:config:set --backend-frontname="backend_front_name"
```

This command updates the `backend` > `frontName` configuration option in the `app/etc/env.php` file.

## Restore the default Admin URL and Admin path

In case you have set an invalid Admin URL or an Admin Path and lost access to the backend, there is a way to fix it from the command line.

1. To revert to the default Admin URL, execute this command:

   ```terminal
   php bin/magento config:set admin/url/use_custom 0
   ```

1. To revert to the default Admin Path (set in the `app/etc/env.php` as described in the Method 2), execute this command :

   ```terminal
   php bin/magento config:set admin/url/use_custom_path 0
   ```

1. Use one of the following methods to clear the cache:

   - On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL System]** > _[!UICONTROL Tools]_ > **[!UICONTROL Cache Management]**. Then, click **[!UICONTROL Flush Magento Cache]**.
   - On the server, execute the following:

      ```terminal
      php bin/magento cache:flush
      ```
