# Storefront order management

Customers have access to all of their orders from their account. Orders can be viewed, filtered, tracked, and resubmitted as new orders. Depending on the status of the order, customers can print their orders, invoices, shipments, and refund records.

## Filter orders

{{b2b-feature}}

Your initial _[!UICONTROL My Orders]_ results also contain matching orders from subordinate users from all websites within the commerce instance. A customer that is associated with a company account can filter the orders list to quickly find records within the results. To show the filter options, the customer clicks **[!UICONTROL Filter]**, and clicks **[!UICONTROL Close]** to hide the filters.
