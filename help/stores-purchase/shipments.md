# Shipments

The _Shipments_ grid lists the shipment record of all invoices that have been prepared for shipping. A shipment record can be generated when an order is [invoiced](invoices.md) or later.

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source support partial and complete order shipment, with additional options available from [Inventory Management](../inventory-management/introduction.md) and third-party extensions.

## Create a shipment

If you have Inventory Management enabled, select a source (or location) and an amount of quantity to send per line item. 

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid and open it.

1. If the order is paid, invoiced, and ready to ship, click **Ship**.

   The sections at the top of the shipment contain name, address, and payment information from the sales order.

1. Click **Save Config**.

## Cancel a shipment

Before a shipment is dispatched to a carrier, it can be canceled by opening the order and navigating to the shipment, provided the carrier supports cancellations. Some carriers restrict or limit cancellations after a booking. For example, UPS allows cancellations, but requires that you wait 24 hours after the shipment is booked. If a shipment is canceled, the cancellation cannot be reversed. The only recourse is to recreate the order.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Sales** > **Orders**.

1. Find the order in the grid.

1. In the _Action_ column, choose **View**.

1. In the left panel, choose **Shipments**.

   If the shipment can be canceled, _Cancel Shipment_ appears as an option in the top button bar.

1. Click **Cancel Shipment**.

1. When prompted to confirm, click **OK**.

The status of the shipment changes to `Canceled`. If the carrier does not support cancellations, an error message appears and explains why the shipment could not be canceled.
