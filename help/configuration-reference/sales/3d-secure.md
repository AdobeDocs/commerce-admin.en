3-D Secure was developed by Visa to promote secure online transactions. Examples of 3-D Secure solutions created by card networks are verified by Visa, Mastercard SecureCode, American Express SafeKey, and CardinalCommerce Consumer Authentication. CardinalCommerce is a global leader in digital transaction authentication, and a wholly owned subsidiary of Visa.
