# Security > 2FA

>[!NOTE]
>
>Stores that have enabled Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) authentication have native Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source 2FA disabled. Admin users who are logged into their Adobe Commerce instance with their Adobe credentials do not need to reauthenticate for many Admin tasks. Authentication is handled by Adobe IMSÂ when the Admin user logs into their current session. See [Integrating Adobe Commerce with Adobe IMS overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-integration-overview.html).
