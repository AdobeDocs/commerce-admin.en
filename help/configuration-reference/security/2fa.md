# [!UICONTROL Security] > [!UICONTROL 2FA]

>[!NOTE]
>
>Stores that have enabled Adobe Identity Management Services (IMS) authentication have native Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source two-factor authentication (2FA) disabled. Admin users who are logged into their Adobe Commerce instance with their Adobe credentials do not need to reauthenticate for many Admin tasks. Authentication is handled by Adobe IMSÂ when the Admin user logs into their current session. See [Integrating Adobe Commerce with Adobe IMS overview](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/start/admin/ims/adobe-ims-integration-overview.html).

For more information about changing these settings, see [Two-factor authentication (2FA)](../../systems/security-two-factor-authentication.md) in the _Admin Systems Guide_.
