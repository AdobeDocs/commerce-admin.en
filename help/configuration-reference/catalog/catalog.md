|[!UICONTROL Use Categories Path for Product URLs]|Store View| Determines if category paths are included in product URLs. Doing so can cause multiple URLs to point to the same page, which might impact search rank. To learn more, see [Canonical meta tag](../../merchandising-promotions/meta-data.md#canonical-meta-tag).                                                                                                                                          |

|[!UICONTROL Apply transliteration for product URL]|Store View| Determines if transliteration is applied when creating or updating product URLs. Options: `Yes` / `No`. Default is set to `Yes`. <br/><br/>For certain use cases, you should disable transliteration. For example, if you operate an online store in Chinese, SEO best practices recommend that product URLs match the product name. Setting the option to `No` allows Chinese characters to be used in product URLs instead of an ASCII equivalent.    |
|[!UICONTROL Page Title Separator]|Store View| Identifies the character that separates the category name and subcategory in the browser title bar.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|[!UICONTROL Use Canonical Link Meta Tag for Categories]|Store View| If there are multiple URLs that point to the same category page, this option uses a canonical meta tag to identify the category URL that search engines should index. The URL includes a full name to the category using the meta tag. This reduces duplicate content and improves SEO. Options: `Yes` / `No`                                                                                            |
|[!UICONTROL Use Canonical Link Meta Tag for Products]|Store View| If there are multiple URLs that point to the same product page, this option uses a canonical meta tag to identify the product URL that search engines should index. The URL includes a full name to the product using the meta tag. This reduces duplicate content and improves SEO. Options: `Yes` / `No`                                                                                               |

|[!UICONTROL Maximum Query Length]|Store View|The maximum number of characters allowed in a catalog search.

{style="table-layout:auto"}

### Adobe Commerce with native search

Native Adobe Commerce with OpenSearch or Elasticsearch includes the following configuration settings:

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>- Due to the Elasticsearch 7 end-of-support announcement for August 2023, Adobe recommends that all Adobe Commerce customers migrate to the OpenSearch 2.x search engine. For information about migrating your search engine during an upgrade, see [Migrating to OpenSearch](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/upgrade-guide/prepare/opensearch-migration.html) in the _Upgrade Guide_.
>- In versions 2.4.4 and 2.4.3-p2, all fields labeled Elasticsearch also apply to OpenSearch. When support for Elasticsearch 8.x was introduced in version 2.4.6, new labels were created to distinguish between Elasticsearch and OpenSearch configurations. However, the configuration options for both are the same.
