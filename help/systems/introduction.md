# Introduction to systems and Admin integrations



## Data Transfer

Use the [data transfer](data-transfer.md) tools to import and export data, as well as manage product, pricing, customer, and tax rate data.

## Integrations

Establish the location of OAuth credentials and redirect URL for [third-party integrations](integrations.md), and identify available API resources. 

## Admin user accounts and permissions

Manage Admin [user accounts](permissions-users-all.md), as well as the associated [roles and permissions](permissions-user-roles.md) that control their access to sites and functional areas in the Admin.

## Action logs

Access the records ([action logs](action-log.md)) for changes made by Admin users working in your store.

## Security

Review [security](security.md) best practices, and learn how to manage Admin sessions and credentials, implement CAPTCHA, and manage website restrictions.

## System tools

Perform routine [index](index-management.md) and [cache](cache-management.md) management operations, [back up](backups.md) the system, manage [scheduled operations](data-scheduled-import-export.md), and use an assortment of [developer tools](developer-tools.md).

## Communications

One of the tasks to complete before launching your store is to review the [email templates](email-templates.md) that are used for all communications sent from your store to make sure that they reflect your brand. This section of the guide provides detailed information about customizing email and newsletter templates, as well as PDF invoices and packing slips. It also includes personalizing the content with variables and markup tags.

## Variables

Variables are pieces of information that can be created once and used in multiple places. Your store includes a large number of predefined variables that can be easily used to personalize [email](email-templates.md) and [newsletter](../merchandising-promotions/newsletter-template.md) templates, as well as other types of [content](../content-design/introduction.md#content). You can also create custom variables to incorporate information that is specific to your needs.

- [Custom Variables](variables-custom.md)

The support tools are designed to identify known issues in your system. They can be used as a resource during the development and optimization processes, and as a diagnostic tool to help our support team identify and resolve issues.
