## [!UICONTROL Permissions]

The [Action Log](action-log.md) tracks the activities of administrators who work in your store. For most events, the available information includes the action, the name of the user, whether it was a success or failure, and the ID of the object that was the target of the action. The Admin Actions archive lists the CSV log files that are stored on the server.

## [!UICONTROL Other Settings]

Manage the [notifications](notifications.md) in your inbox, create [custom variables](variables-custom.md), and generate a new [encryption key](encryption-key.md).
