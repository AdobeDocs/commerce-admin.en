# Cron (scheduled tasks)

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source perform some operations on schedule by periodically running a script. You can control the execution and scheduling of Commerce cron jobs from the Admin. Store operations that run according to a cron schedule include, but are not limited to:

- [Email](email-communications.md)
- [Catalog Price Rules](../merchandising-promotions/price-rules-catalog.md)
- [Newsletters](../merchandising-promotions/newsletters.md)
- [XMLÂ Sitemap Generation](../merchandising-promotions/sitemap-xml.md)
- [Currency Rate Updates](../stores-purchase/currency-update.md)
- [Inventory Management](../inventory-management/introduction.md)

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>Commerce services must be installed in crontab to ensure that core components, and some third-party extensions, to function as expected. See the [instructions in the _Installation Guide_](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/next-steps/configuration.html) for detailed information about installing services to crontab.

In addition, you can configure the following to run according to a cron schedule:

- Order System Grid Updates and Reindexing
- Pending Payment Lifetime

Make sure that the [base URLs](../stores-purchase/store-urls.md) for the store are set correctly so that the URLs that are generated during cron operations are correct. For Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure, see [Set up cron jobs](https://devdocs.magento.com/cloud/configure/setup-cron-jobs.html){:target="_blank"} in the _Cloud for Adobe Commerce Guide_. For on-premise, see [Configure and run con](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/configuration-guide/cli/configure-cron-jobs.html){:target="_blank"} in the _Configuration Guide_.
