# Media - Image

Use the _Image_ content type to add a JPG, GIF, or PNG image to the [[!DNL Page Builder] stage](workspace.md#stage). In addition to the default desktop image, you can specify a secondary image for mobile devices. You can also add a caption that appears below the image and link the image to any URL, product, category, or page.

>You can use the [Adobe Stock Integration](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/cms/adobe-stock.html) to find and save an appropriate asset from among the millions provided by [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com). See [Using Adobe Stock Images](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/cms/adobe-stock-manage.html) for details about how to search, refine, and save Adobe Stock assets into your gallery.

1. If needed, specify a **[!UICONTROL Link]** for the image.

   The link is the destination page that appears when the customer clicks the image. You can use one of three link types:

   - **[!UICONTROL URL]** - Links to either a relative or fully qualified URL.

      ![Link to a URL](./assets/pb-media-image-settings-image-link-url-newtab.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - **[!UICONTROL Product]** - Identifies the destination page based on the product name or SKU. Search for the product by name based on either a partial or full name. Choose the product from the search results list.

      ![Choosing a product to link](./assets/pb-media-image-settings-image-link-product-results.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - **[!UICONTROL Category]** - Identifies the destination page as a specific category or subcategory in the category tree. Search for the category based on either a partial or full name. Choose the category from the expanded section of the displayed tree.

      ![Choosing a category to link](./assets/pb-media-image-settings-image-link-category-tree.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - **[!UICONTROL Page]** - Identifies the destination page as a specific content page. Search for the page based on either a partial or full name. Choose the page from the search results list.

      ![Choosing a page to link](./assets/pb-media-image-settings-image-link-page-results.png)<!-- zoom -->

   If you want to prevent the visitor from navigating away from your store, select the **[!UICONTROL Open in new tab]** checkbox. When the checkbox is cleared, the linked destination opens in the same browser tab, which could effectively navigate the visitor away from your store.

1. To add an **[!UICONTROL Image Caption]**, enter the text that you want to appear below the image.

   The format of the caption is determined by the stylesheet that is associated with the current theme.

   ![Image caption](./assets/pb-media-image-settings-caption.png)<!-- zoom -->

   The caption typically appears below the image, and provides information about the image for visitors and search engines. If your site is available in multiple languages, you might use the same image, but  translate the caption. In HTML, the `<figcaption>` tag is a subset of the `<figure>` tag. `<figcaption>This is the image caption</figcaption>`

1. Update any of the other settings as needed:

   - [Search Engine Optimization](#search-engine-optimization)
   - [Advanced](#advanced)

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save]** to apply the settings and return to the [!DNL Page Builder] workspace.

## Move an image

1. Hover over the image container to display the toolbox and choose the _Move_ (![Move icon](./assets/pb-icon-move.png)) icon.

   ![Moving an image](./assets/pb-media-image-column1-move-giftcard.png)<!-- zoom -->

1. Select and drag the image to the new position, just below the red guideline.

   ![Using the red guideline to position the image](./assets/pb-media-image-column2-move-giftcard-red-guideline.png)<!-- zoom -->

## Remove an image

1. Hover over the image container to display the toolbox and choose the _Remove_ (![Remove icon](./assets/pb-icon-remove.png)) icon.

1. When prompted to confirm, click **[!UICONTROL OK]**.

## Search Engine Optimization

Text for these settings is visible to search engines and improves the way the page is indexed.

- For **[!UICONTROL Alternative Text]**, enter an _alt_ text description for digital accessibility tools to display.

   The use of alt text is an accessibility best practice, and is required by law in some locales. In HTML, the `alt` attribute is a subset of the `image` tag: `<image title="tooltip" alt="description" src="image.jpg">`.

- For **[!UICONTROL Title Attribute]**, enter the text to display as a tooltip on mouseover.

   As a best practice, choose a descriptive, keyword-rich title to improve the way the image is indexed by search engines. In HTML, the `title` attribute is a subset of the `image` tag: `<image title="tooltip" alt="description" src="image.jpg">`.

## [!UICONTROL Advanced]

- To control the horizontal positioning of the images added to the container, choose an **[!UICONTROL Alignment]**.

   | Option | Description |
   | ------ | ----------- |

   | `Left` | Aligns the image content along the left border of the image container, with allowance for any padding that is specified. |

   | `Groove` | The container border appears as a grooved line. |
   | `Ridge` | The container border appears as a ridged line. |

   | [!UICONTROL Margins] | The amount of blank space that is applied to the outside edge of all sides of the container. |
   | [!UICONTROL Padding] | The amount of blank space that is applied to the inside edge of all sides of the container. |
