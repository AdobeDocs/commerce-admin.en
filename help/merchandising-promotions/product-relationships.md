# Product relationships

Products in your catalog can be promoted on other pages by defining the nature of the relationship between the products. The options available are:

## Related Products

[Related Products](../catalog/related-products-up-sells-cross-sells.md) are meant to be purchased in addition to the item the customer is viewing. They complement, enhance, or add optional features to the product.

## Up-sells

[Up-sell products](../catalog/related-products-up-sells-cross-sells.md) are items that are similar, but are perhaps of a higher-quality, more popular, or have a better profit margin than the item the customer is considering.

## Cross-sells

[Cross-sell products](../catalog/related-products-up-sells-cross-sells.md) are offered on the shopping cart page as last-minute purchases before the checkout process begins.

## Related Product Rules
