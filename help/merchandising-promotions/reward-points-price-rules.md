# Reward points in price rules

{{ee-feature}}

Reward points can be awarded to customers according to a [cart price rule](price-rules-cart.md). The award of points can be the only action of the price rule, or can be used with a discount.

1. Follow the standard instructions to complete the [cart price rule](price-rules-cart-create.md).

   When the price rule is activated, a message appears in the cart to let customers know how many points they can earn by placing the order. This applies only to registered users and may vary when a user is logged in.
