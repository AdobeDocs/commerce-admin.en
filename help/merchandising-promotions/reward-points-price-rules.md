# Reward points in price rules

{{ee-feature}}

Reward points can be awarded to customers on the basis of a [cart price rule](price-rules-cart.md). The award of points can be the only action of the price rule, or can be used in combination with a discount.

## Add reward points to a price rule

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **Marketing** > _Promotions_ > **Cart Price Rules**.

1. Click **Add New Rule** to create a cart price rule or click an existing cart price rule to open it.

1. Scroll down, expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Actions** section, set the conditions, and enter the amount of points in the **Add Reward Points** field.

1. Follow the standard instructions to complete the [cart price rule](price-rules-cart-create.md).

   When the price rule is activated, a message appears in the cart to let customers know how many points they can earn by placing the order. This applies only to registered users and may vary when a user is logged in.
