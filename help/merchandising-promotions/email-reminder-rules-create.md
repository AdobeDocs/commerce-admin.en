# Create email reminders

Before setting up an email reminder rule, you must first set up a cart price rule to define the promotion that is being offered. Rule conditions that trigger an email reminder can be based on cart properties, wishlist properties, or both.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Email reminders might promote a cart price rule with, or without, a coupon. A cart price rule that defines an auto-generated coupon generates a random coupon code for each customer.

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > _[!UICONTROL Communications]_ > **[!UICONTROL Email Reminder Rules]**.

1. In the upper-right corner, click **[!UICONTROL Add New Rule]**.

1. Complete the _[!UICONTROL Rule Information]_, as follows:

    ![Email reminder rule](./assets/email-reminder-new.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - Enter a **[!UICONTROL Rule Name]** to identify the rule internally.

   - Enter a brief **[!UICONTROL Description]** of the rule.

   - To choose the **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rule]** promotion that this reminder is to advertise, click **[!UICONTROL Select Ruleâ€¦]**, and select the rule.

      ![Cart rule - select](./assets/email-reminder-select-rule.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - If you want the rule to go into effect immediately, set **[!UICONTROL Status]** to `Active`.

   - To set up a date range for the rule to be active, enter the **[!UICONTROL From]** and **[!UICONTROL To]** dates.

      You can also choose the date from the Calendar ( ![Calendar icon](../assets/icon-calendar.png) ).

   - To send the reminder more than once, enter the number of days before the next email blast in the **[!UICONTROL Repeat Schedule]** field.

1. In the panel on the left, choose **[!UICONTROL Conditions]**.

   At least one condition must be defined for the rule. The process is similar to building a [catalog price rule.](price-rules-catalog.md)

   ![Email reminder conditions](./assets/email-reminder-conditions.png)<!-- zoom -->

   Click _Add_ ( ![Add icon](../assets/icon-add-green-circle.png)) to display the list of options and then choose one of the following conditions:

      - Wish List
      - Shopping Cart

   Complete the condition to describe the scenario that triggers the email reminder.

1. In the **[!UICONTROL Email Templates]** section, choose the email template to be used for each website and store view in your [store hierarchy](../getting-started/websites-stores-views.md).

   If you do not want to send the reminder email to customers of a store view, leave the value `Not Selected`.

1. In the _Default Titles and Description_ section, do the following:

   - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Rule Title for All Store Views]**.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >This value can be incorporated into email templates by using the `promotion_name` variable.

   - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Rule Description for All Store Views]**.

      ![Email reminders - titles and descriptions](./assets/email-reminders-emails-and-labels-default-titles-description.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - In the _[!UICONTROL Titles and Descriptions Per Store View]_ section, enter the **[!UICONTROL Rule Title]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** for the _Default Store View_. For multiple store views, enter the appropriate title and description for each.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >The description can be incorporated into email templates by using the promotion_description variable.
