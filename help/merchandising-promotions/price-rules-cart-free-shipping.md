# Cart price rule example - free shipping promotion

Free shipping can be offered as a promotion, either with, or without a [coupon](price-rules-cart-coupon.md). A free shipping coupon, or voucher, can also be applied to customer pick-upÂ orders, so the order can be invoiced and shipped to complete the [workflow](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/sales/order-workflow.html).
