# Cart price rule example - free shipping promotion

Free shipping can be offered as a promotion, either with, or without a [coupon](price-rules-cart-coupon.md). A free shipping coupon, or voucher, can also be applied to customer pick-upÂ orders, so the order can be invoiced and shipped to complete the [workflow](../stores-purchase/order-processing.md#order-workflow-and-processing).

Some shipping carrier configurations give you the ability to offer free shipping based on a minimum order. To expand upon this basic capability, you can use shopping cart price rules to create complex conditions based on multiple product attributes, cart contents, and customer groups.

## Step 1. Enable free shipping

1. Enable [free shipping](../stores-purchase/shipping-free.md) in your store configuration.

1. Complete the free shipping settings for any [carrier service](../stores-purchase/carriers.md) that you want to use for free shipping.

## Step 2. Create a cart price rule

On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > _[!UICONTROL Promotions]_ > **[!UICONTROL Cart Price Rules]**.
