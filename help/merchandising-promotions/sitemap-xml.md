# Site maps

A site map improves the way that your store is indexed by search engines, and is designed to find pages that might be overlooked by web crawlers. A site map can be configured to index all pages and images.

When enabled, Commerce creates a file called `sitemap.xml` that is saved to your installation in the location that you specify. The configuration gives you the ability to set the frequency of the updates, and the priority for each type of content. Your site map should be updated as frequently as the content on your site changes, which might be daily, weekly, or monthly.

While your site is in development, you might include instructions in the `robots.txt` file for web crawlers to avoid indexing the site. Then before the launch, you can change the instructions to allow the site to be indexed.

For technical information, see [Add sitemap and robots.txt][1] in the _Commerce on Cloud Infrastructure Guide_.

## Step 1. Configure the site map

Complete the [XML Sitemap configuration](#site-map-configuration) to determine what is included, and how frequently the site map is updated.

## Step 2. Generate the site map

1. On the _Admin_ menu, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > _[!UICONTROL SEO & Search]_ > **[!UICONTROL Site Map]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add Site Map]** and do the following:

    ![Site map grid](./assets/marketing-sitemap.png)<!-- zoom -->

    - Enter the site map **[!UICONTROL Filename]**. For example: `sitemap.xml`

    - Enter the **[!UICONTROL Path]** to determine where the site map file is to reside on the server. Make sure that the path is writeable.

      - `/sitemap/` - Places the site map file in a directory called _sitemap_.

      - `/` - Places the site map file at the base path, or root of your Commerce installation.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save & Generate]**.

    It might take a few minutes for the site map to appear in the grid.

## Step 3. Configure and enable robots.txt (optional)

Complete the [search engine robots](seo-overview.md#search-engine-robots) configuration with instructions that direct search engines to crawl the parts of your site that you want to be indexed.

## Step 4. Submit your site map to search engines

You can submit your site map to different search engines by providing them the link to the `sitemap.xml` file in your Commerce installation. To copy the link, do the following:

1. In the _Site Map_ list, right-click the URL in the **[!UICONTROL Link for Google]** column.

1. On the menu, choose **[!UICONTROL Copy Link Address]**.

For more information, see the instructions for the specific search engine. Here are links to instructions for two top search engines:

- [Google][2]
- [Microsoft&reg; Bing][3]

## Step 5: Restore previous robot instructions (optional)

You can now restore either the original (default) restrictions.

## Manage sitemaps and robots.txt for multiple websites

If you have multiple websites, you can simplify the process of creating and submitting sitemaps. Simply [create](#site-map-configuration) one or more sitemaps that include URLs for all your verified stores and save the sitemaps to a single location. All sites must be verified in [Google Search Console](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451001).

To create sitemaps for a multistore instance, do the following:

1. Create a folder called `sitemaps` at the root of your website, then create subfolders for each domain:

       /sitemaps/domain_1/
       /sitemaps/domain_2/

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Marketing]** > _[!UICONTROL SEO & Search]_ > **[!UICONTROL Site Map]**.

1. Create or edit the sitemap listings for each store and set the **[!UICONTROL Path]** to the one you created for the store:

   `/sitemaps/domain_1/`
   `/sitemaps/domain_2/`

1. If needed, update your robots.txt file.

   To make sure that the search engine spiders are properly directed to the new sitemaps, you can update or create the robots.txt file. Add the following lines at the top.

         Website Sitemap
         Sitemap: https://www.domain_1.com/sitemaps/domain_1/sitemap.xml
         Sitemap: https://www.domain_2.com/sitemaps/domain_2/sitemap.xml

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your site uses the [Apache](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-operations/installation-guide/prerequisites/web-server/apache.html) web server engine, you should update the [`.htaccess`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/howto/htaccess.html) file in the root of your website to direct any other sitemap requests to the proper place.
