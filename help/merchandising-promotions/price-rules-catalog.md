# Catalog price rules

Catalog price rules can be used to offer products to buyers at a discounted price, based on a set of defined conditions. Catalog price rules do not use [coupon codes](price-rules-cart-coupon.md), because they are triggered before a product is placed into the shopping cart.

For example, you can define and set the conditions for a price rule that when met, automatically display products with a special or promotional price. Defined rule properties might include customer groups, product categories, a discount amount or percentage, product color, product size, or just about any product attribute set up in your store. You can set start and end dates for a price rule that automatically start and stop a promotion on the dates you define in the rule. The properties of a saved rule can be updated or modified as needed.

- ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) You can also link a defined rule to a [dynamic block](../content-design/dynamic-blocks.md) to help promote the event or product in your store.

- ![Magento Open Source](../assets/open-source.svg) (Magento Open Source only) For recurring promotions, you can manually set a saved rule to _Active_ or _Inactive_ status each time you want to run the promotion.
