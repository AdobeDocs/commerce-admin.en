# Newsletters and subscriptions

Publishing a regular newsletter is considered to be one of the most powerful and affordable marketing tools available. Commerce gives you the ability to publish and distribute newsletters to customers who have subscribed, plus tools to produce your newsletter, build and manage your list of subscribers, develop content, and drive traffics to your store. You can also use [page hierarchy](../content-design/page-hierarchy.md) to create an archive of past issues.

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can add capabilities by integrating your Commerce instance with a third-party newsletter service provider and by adding extensions. To learn more, see [Commerce Marketplace](../getting-started/commerce-marketplace.md).

The first step in creating newsletters is to configure the newsletter settings for your site. You can require customers to click a confirmation link that is sent by email to confirm the subscription. This double opt-in method requires customers to confirm twice that they want to receive your newsletter and reduces the possibility that it might be considered to be spam.

## Enable newsletters

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Customers]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Newsletter]**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL General Options]** section.

1. To enable newsletters for the store view scope, set **[!UICONTROL Enabled]** to `Yes`.

After enabling the newsletter function, the _[!UICONTROL Subscription Options]_ section appears.

## Configure the subscription options

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]**.

1. In the left panel, expand **[!UICONTROL Customers]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Newsletter]**.

1. If needed, [change the configuration scope](../getting-started/websites-stores-views.md#scope-settings) to apply the newsletter configuration changes to a specific site/store view.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Subscription Options]** section and do the following:

   ![Customers configuration - newsletter subscriptions](../configuration-reference/customers/assets/newsletter-subscription-options.png)<!-- zoom -->

   - Confirm the email template and sender of each of the following email messages that are sent to subscribers:

      - [!UICONTROL Success email]
      - [!UICONTROL Confirmation email]
      - [!UICONTROL Unsubscribe email]

   - To use the double opt-in process to confirm subscriptions, set **[!UICONTROL Need to Confirm]** to `Yes`.

   - To allow people who do not have an account with your store to subscribe to the newsletter, set **[!UICONTROL Allow Guest Subscription]** to `Yes`.

1. When complete, click **[!UICONTROL Save Config]**.
