Welcome to the next generation of the world’s leading digital commerce platform. Adobe Commerce provides online merchants with unparalleled flexibility and control over the look, content, and functionality of their online stores. The Admin features powerful marketing, search engine optimization, and product management tools that give you the power to create sites that are tailored to your unique business needs.

## Product editions

Adobe offers two Commerce editions to fit the requirements of your eCommerce business. The information in the user documentation is designed to accommodate business users from either edition, with notations for features and functions that are specific to one edition or an extended feature set.

- **Magento Open Source** is a self-hosted eCommerce platform with essential commerce features available free of charge. It offers you a stable and customizable solution for your growing small business or as a tool to prototype new ideas and business models for larger merchants.

- **Adobe Commerce** is an enterprise-level eCommerce platform that provides a richer set of out-of-the-box features, with an unlimited ability to customize and seamlessly integrate with third-party providers. Robust and scalable, Adobe Commerce offers you a stable, secure, and customizable solution for your growing business. Adobe Commerce includes one of our cloud infrastructure options as well as 24/7 customer support. It is designed to allow you to sell multiple brands, geographies, currencies as well as to both B2C and B2B buyers from a single platform. For a list of the advanced capabilities included with Adobe Commerce, see Commerce features in our developer documentation.
