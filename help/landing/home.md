Welcome to the next generation of the world's leading digital commerce platform. Adobe Commerce provides online merchants with unparalleled flexibility and control over the look, content, and functionality of their online stores. The Admin features powerful marketing, search engine optimization, and product management tools that give you the power to create sites that are tailored to your unique business needs.

The information in the merchant documentation is designed to accommodate business users working in Adobe Commerce or the Magento Open Source code base. There are notations for features and functions that are exclusive to Adobe Commerce, or to an extended feature set.
