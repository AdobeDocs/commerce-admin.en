# Install a New Theme

When you first install [!DNL Commerce] the design elements of the store are based on the default _[!DNL Magento Blank]_ theme. The _Luma_ theme is also available if you installed the sample data. You can modify a theme, add themes created by others, or create new ones. [[!DNL Commerce Marketplace]](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/magento/magento-marketplace.html) contains a growing selection of themes that you can install to change the appearance of your store. To learn how to create or modify a theme, see our [Frontend Developer Guide][1].
