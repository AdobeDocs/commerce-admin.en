# Install a New Theme

When you first install [!DNL Commerce] the design elements of the store are based on the default _[!DNL Magento Blank]_ theme. The _Luma_ theme is also available if you installed the sample data. You can modify a theme, add themes created by others, or create your own. [[!DNL Commerce Marketplace]](../getting-started/commerce-marketplace.md) contains a growing selection of themes that you can install to change the appearance of your store. To learn how to create or modify a theme, see the [_Frontend Development Guide_][1].
