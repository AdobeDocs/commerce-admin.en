# Use Adobe Stock Images

[Adobe Stock][adobe-stock] images can be used in place of uploading your own image content. One common use case is to upload and place image content when creating a page.

The [[!DNL Media Gallery]](media-gallery.md) provides a direct integration with Adobe Stock, making it easy to license your images directly from the gallery page.

## Access the Adobe Stock search grid

The Adobe Stock search panel is accessible when you [add or edit a page](page-add.md), when you [create or edit a category](../catalog/category-create.md), or when you [insert images via the Content Editor](editor-insert-image.md).

To search Adobe Stock assets and add a stock image to a page:

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to **[!UICONTROL Content]** > _[!UICONTROL Elements]_ > **[!UICONTROL Pages]**.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Add a New Page]**.

   If you want to edit an existing page, you can use the _[!UICONTROL Action]_ column to click **[!UICONTROL Select]** and choose **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **[!UICONTROL Content]** section and do the following:

   - If you have the [WYSIWYG editor enabled](editor.md), click **[!UICONTROL Show/Hide Editor]** and then click **[!UICONTROL Insert Image]**.

   - If you have [Page Builder enabled](../page-builder/setup.md), expand the **[!UICONTROL Media]** panel and drag an **Image** placeholder to the target container. Then click **[!UICONTROL Select from Gallery]**.

## Filter and search for Adobe Stock assets

The [Adobe Stock search Grid][access-search] provides querying and filtering functionality to help you find the perfect image for your [!DNL Commerce] stores.

By default, the search results shown are from an Adobe Stock curated gallery of a few hundred results. When you apply your own keyword search, you are searching the millions of assets available via Adobe Stock.

### Search for Adobe Stock assets by keywords

1. [Access the Adobe Stock Search grid][access-search].

1. Enter your keyword search into the **[!UICONTROL Search by keyword]** input field in the top-left and click the magnifying glass or press **Enter**.

### Save images to the media storage

Images searched using the Adobe Stock integration can be saved to the [!DNL Commerce] [media storage][media-storage] for easy reuse across your [!DNL Commerce] store.

You can save two types of images: an [image preview][save-preview] or a [licensed image][save-licensed].

#### Save an image preview

An image preview is a watermarked version of an Adobe Stock asset. Image previews are free and are a good way to experiment with different images before you decide to purchase a license for specific images and use them on your production stores.

1. To [view the image details][view-details], click an image in the search grid.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save Preview]**.

   This action displays a prompt for you to specify a file name that is used to save the image to the [media storage][media-storage]. A default file name is provided, but you can customize the name to your preferences.

    ![Save Adobe Stock preview image](./assets/adobe-stock-save-preview.png){width="500" zoomable="yes"}

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

    The page redirects to the [media storage][media-storage] and your saved preview is displayed.

#### Save a licensed image

Adobe Stock assets that you want to use for your production [!DNL Commerce] stores should be licensed. Licensing ensures that you have legal access to the image and to eliminate the Adobe Stock watermark that is present on all [image previews][save-preview]. To license images or to save already-licensed images, you must be logged in to your Adobe account.

1. [Log in to your Adobe account][log-in-to-adobe-account].

1. To [view the image details][view-details], click an image in the search grid. 

1. Depending on the current licensing status of the image, do one of the following:

   - If the image is already licensed, click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   - If the image is _not_ licensed, click **[!UICONTROL License and Save]**.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >You must have available [Adobe Stock credits][stock-credits] in your account to license the image.

   This action displays a prompt for you to specify a file name that is used to save the image to the [media storage][media-storage]. A default file name is provided, but you can customize the name to your preferences.

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Confirm]**.

    The page redirects to the [media storage][media-storage] and your saved preview is displayed.
