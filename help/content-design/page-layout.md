# Page Layouts

The layout of each page in your store consists of distinct sections, or containers, that define the header, footer, and content areas of the page. Depending on the layout, each page might have one, two, three columns, or more. You can think of the layout as the _floor plan_ of the page, and assign a specific layout to be used as the default for CMS, product, and category pages.

On the page, content blocks float to fill the available space, according to the section of the [page layout](layout-updates.md) where they are assigned to appear. You will discover that if you change the layout from a three-column to a two-column layout, the content of the main area expands to fill the available space, and any blocks that are associated with the unused side bar seem to disappear. However, if you restore the three-column layout, the blocks reappear. This fluid approach, or _liquid layout_, makes it possible to change the page layout without having to rework the content. If you are used to working with individual HTML pages, you will discover that this modular, _building block_ approach requires a different way of thinking.

## Standard Page Layouts

### One Column

![Diagram - one-column layout](./assets/layout-1-col-th.png)

The _1 Column_ [layout](page-layout.md) can be used to create a dramatic home page with a large image or focal point. It is also a good choice for a landing page, or any other page that has a combination of text, images, and video.

### Two columns with left bar

![Diagram - two-column layout with left bar](./assets/layout-2-col-lft-bar-th.png)

The _2 Columns with Left Bar_ layout is often used for pages with navigation on the left, such as a catalog or search results pages with layered navigation. It is also an excellent choice for home pages that need additional navigation or blocks of supporting content on the left.

### Two columns with right bar

![Diagram - ttwo-column layout with right bar](./assets/layout-2-col-rt-bar-th.png)

With a _2 Columns with Right Bar_ layout, the main content area is large enough for an eye-catching image or banner. This layout is also often used for Product pages with blocks of supporting content on the right.
