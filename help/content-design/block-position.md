# Position content blocks

The code that controls the page layout and placement of blocks is written in XML [Widgets](widgets.md). These widgets make it easy to position a block at a specific place on the page, and even for a specific product or category without writing any code. You can choose each option from a list, rather than trying to remember all possible combinations.

The following list describes the locations by page type where blocks are typically placed. For more information about how areas on the page are defined, see [Standard Page Layouts](page-layout.md#standard-page-layouts).

## Category and CMS pages

| Block reference | Position |
|----------|-------- |
| [!UICONTROL Breadcrumbs] | The navigation aid at the top of many pages that shows your current location as a link. Any additional content placed in the breadcrumbs reference floats to the right of the breadcrumbs, if displayed. |
| [!UICONTROL Left Column] | Content is added to the left column. |
| [!UICONTROL Main Content Area] | Content is added to the main content area. |
