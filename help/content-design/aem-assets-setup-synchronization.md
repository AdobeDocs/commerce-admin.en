# Set up the synchronization service

The Asset Rules Engine Service (ARES) is a multi-tenant service that integrates AEM Assets with Adobe Commerce. This service synchronizes assets between Adobe Commerce and Experience Manager. The ARES service automatically matches assets in AEM to products in Adobe Commerce based on SKU or other key attributes. It also ensures that the latest product assets and variations are always available on the ecommerce site.

To set up the service, you need to register your tenant ID using the ARES GraphQL API and select the matching strategy for synchronizing assets.


## Register a tenant

>[!BEGINSHADEBOX]

**Prerequisite**

- A configured production environment is required for an Experience Manager Assets instance to connect with the Commerce tenant. See [Configure Experience Manager Assets](aem-assets-configure-aem.md)
- Program and environment identifier from the AEM asset organization owning the repository of assets. AEM project and environment IDâ€”Get these credentials from the AEM URL `https://author-p<project-id>-e<environment-id>-cmstg.adobeaemcloud.com/aem/start.html`.
- Credentials to authenticate the authentication
  - projectId: SaaS project Id (from Commerce Services Connector)
  - commerce: Commerce credentials

>[!ENDSHADEBOX]

You complete tenant registration by submitting a registration request to the Assets Rule Engine Service using a GraphQL client. The request includes credentials and project identifiers required to establish the connections between the service, the Commerce project, and the Experience Manager Assets project.

Use a GraphQL client to send a POST request to the API endpoint.

**Required headers**

Specify the following HTTP headers for the request:

- `x-api-key`: API Key from your Magento account
- `magento-environment-Id`: SaaS identifier
- `x-gw-signature`: JWT Token associated with the MAGEID

**Request:**


**Syntax**

```graphql
mutation registerTenant($tenantInput: TenantInput!) {
   registerTenant(tenantInput: $tenantInput) {
      tenantId
      userErrors {
         message
         path
      }
    }
}
```
