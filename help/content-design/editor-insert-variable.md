# Insert a Variable in the Editor

Your store includes many predefined [variables](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/variables-predefined.html) that can be incorporated into page content and other communications. In addition, you can include your own [custom variables](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/variables-custom.html) that are specific to your needs.

1. Go to the _[!UICONTROL Content]_ section and click any element that supports the editor.

1. Position the cursor where you want the variable to appear and click the _Insert Variable_ icon.
