# AEM Assets Integration

Integrate Adobe Commerce projects with Experience Manager Assets by enabling the Assets integration for Commerce. When the integration is active, administrators can use Experience Manager Assets Cloud Services as the single source of truth for asset creation and management, and as a central digital asset management tool (DAM) to manage, organize, and distribute assets for Commerce storefronts.

The integration relies on the Rules Engine Service to synchronize assets from Experience Manager Assets to matched products in Adobe Commerce, based on SKU, or other key attributes based on your Commerce strategy. Updates are automatically shared to ensure that your site has the latest product assets and asset variations in place.

Create storefronts for new product launches or seasonal campaigns with increased velocity by generating millions of product variations for personalized Commerce experiences using GenAI services in Experience Manager Assets.

Streamline the process to maintain accurate and engaging visual content for Commerce storefronts by integrating Adobe Commerce with Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) Assets.
