>
>When the new [[!DNL Media Gallery]](media-gallery.md) is enabled, the _[!UICONTROL Media]_ section appears with a single option to access the [!DNL Media Gallery]. You can set the **[!UICONTROL Enable Old Media Gallery]** option to `No` by going to **[!UICONTROL Stores]** > _[!UICONTROL Settings]_ > **[!UICONTROL Configuration]** and choosing **[!UICONTROL Advanced]** > **[!UICONTROL System]** in the left panel.

## Display the [!UICONTROL Content] menu

## [!UICONTROL Elements]

- Create [pages](pages.md) with text, images, blocks, variables, and widgets, that can be incorporated into the navigation of your store and can be linked to other pages.
- ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) Organize your pages into a [hierarchy](page-hierarchy.md) with navigation.
- Create [blocks](blocks.md) of content without writing any code. Blocks can contain text, images, and even video, and can be assigned to any part of the page layout.
- ![Adobe Commerce](../assets/adobe-logo.svg) (Adobe Commerce only) Create [dynamic blocks](dynamic-blocks.md) to incorporate rich, interactive content that is driven by logic from [price rules](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/promotions.html) and [customer segments](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/marketing/customer-segments.html).
- Create [widgets](widgets.md) that display dynamic data and add blocks, links, and interactive elements most anywhere in your store.
- Create [templates](../page-builder/templates.md) from your Page Builder content and save time and effort when adding new content (or replacing older content).

>[!NOTE]
>
>The _[!UICONTROL Banners]_ option in this menu was deprecated in 2.3.1 and is now removed. Its functionality is replaced by Dynamic Blocks.
