# Introduction to Commerce Content and Design

The term _content marketing_ refers to the art of promoting your products or services by providing valuable information to your customers at no charge. The quality of your content helps distinguish your store from others, increases your visibility to search engines, and provides support to your customers. This soft-sell approach is often more effective than advertising, builds credibility and trust, and can turn your store into a destination. Content is still king.

Your content should reflect the branding of your store, and be delivered with your distinctive visual presentation and voice to convey your message. Use pictures to tell a story. Educate, inspire, and entertain. Keep in mind that with quality content, sometimes less is more.

## Design

Adobe Commerce and Magento Open Source provide a variety of easy-to-use design options that you can use to make simple changes to your store. You will also find many professionally designed themes available in the Commerce Marketplace. Like the window dressing of your store, you can change the theme for the season or for a promotion.

More advanced users appreciate the flexibility of working with an object-oriented environment that assembles pages from separate components. After you understand the basics, you will appreciate working in such a flexible and fluid environment. To learn more, see the [Frontend Developer Guide][1].

### Configuration

The [Design configuration](configuration.md) lets you easily maintain different settings for each website, store, and view in your Commerce installation.

### Themes

The [theme](themes.md) determines the visual presentation of your store, and consists of a collection of layout files, template files, translation files, and skins.

### Schedule

Themes can be activated for a period of time, according to a [schedule](schedule.md). Use the schedule to plan theme changes in advance for a season or promotion.
