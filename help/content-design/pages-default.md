# Default Pages

The _Default Pages_ configuration determines the landing page that is associated with the [base URL](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/stores/store-urls.html) and the corresponding home page. It also determines which page appears when a _Page Not Found_ error occurs, and if a [breadcrumb trail](https://docs.magento.com/user-guide/catalog/navigation-breadcrumb-trail.html) appears at the top of each page.

## Configure the default pages

1. On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to  **Stores** > _Settings_ > **Configuration**.

1. In the left panel under _General_, choose **Web**.

1. Expand ![Expansion selector](../assets/icon-display-expand.png) the **Default Pages** section.
