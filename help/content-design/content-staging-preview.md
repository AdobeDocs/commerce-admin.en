# Preview a campaign

{{ee-feature}}

Any day or time period during a campaign can be previewed and shared with others.

1. Use one of these methods to open a preview window:

   - _From the Content Staging Dashboard_

      - On the _Admin_ sidebar, go to  **[!UICONTROL Content]** > _[!UICONTROL Content Staging]_ > **[!UICONTROL Dashboard]**.
      - Click any item on the page, and then click **[!UICONTROL Preview]** on the displayed summary information for the campaign.

   - _From any page with scheduled changes_

      - Open any page with a _[!UICONTROL Scheduled Changes]_ box at the top.
      - Click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

   The preview opens in a new browser tab and shows how the product appears during the scheduled campaign.

1. In the upper-left corner of the preview window, click **[!UICONTROL Calendar]**.

   The calendar detail shows other campaigns that are scheduled for the same day. Each record in the list is a separate campaign.

1. Preview a specific day or time:

   - Click the **[!UICONTROL Date & Time]** calendar (![Calendar icon](../assets/icon-calendar.png){width="10" zoomable="no"}).

   - Choose a different date and/or time.

   - Click **[!UICONTROL Preview]**.

1. Change the scope of the preview for a different store view:

   - In the header of the preview page, click **[!UICONTROL Scope]**.

   - Choose the website, store, or store view that you want to preview.

   >[!NOTE]
   >
   >Previews always start from the **default** store view which emulates the customer's experience of navigating through the campaign. Single-stage campaigns may include changes that affect multiple store views and websites. Ensure that these views/websites display the campaign properly.

1. Share a link to the preview:

   - Click **[!UICONTROL Share]** and copy the link to the clipboard.

   - Paste the link into the body of an email message.

      >[!NOTE]
      >
      >An Admin user account is required to see a shared preview. If you have permission to [create an Admin user account](../systems/permissions-users-all.md#create-a-user), you must create the account for a new user before the sharing.

1. To return to the campaign calendar, click **[!UICONTROL Calendar]** in the header of the Preview page.
